## 🎯 What's New in SDLC 5.0.0 (December 6, 2025)

### Stage Restructuring: INTEGRATION → Stage 03 (CRITICAL)

**SDLC 5.0.0** moves **INTEGRATION from Stage 07 to Stage 03** to enforce Contract-First development:

```yaml
Why This Change?
  Problem: In 4.x, INTEGRATE was Stage 07 (after OPERATE)
  Issue: Cannot design APIs after system is in production
  Solution: Move INTEGRATION to Stage 03, BEFORE BUILD (Stage 04)

New Stage Order (Linear 00-07, Continuous 08-09):
  00-foundation    # WHY - Problem Definition
  01-planning      # WHAT - Requirements
  02-design        # HOW - Architecture
  03-integration   # API Design (MOVED FROM 07) ← Contract-First
  04-build         # Development
  05-test          # Quality Assurance
  06-deploy        # Release
  07-operate       # Production
  08-collaborate   # Team (Continuous)
  09-govern        # Compliance (Continuous)

Industry Alignment:
  - ISO/IEC 12207: Integration in Technical processes (before Operation)
  - DevOps CI: Continuous Integration during Build, not post-production
  - NIST SSDF: Secure design before implementation
```

## 🎯 What's New in SDLC 4.9 (November 13, 2025)

### Complete Lifecycle - Not Just Enhancement

**SDLC 4.9 is a MAJOR EVOLUTION of SDLC 4.8**, expanding from 4 core stages to a complete 10-stage lifecycle covering the entire software development journey from strategic foundation to production excellence and governance.

**The Evolution Journey**:
```
SDLC 1.0 (June 2025)
  ↓ CEO + Claude Code collaboration begins
SDLC 3.x (July 2025)
  ↓ BFlow Platform teaches System Thinking
SDLC 4.6 (September 24, 2025)
  ↓ 679 mock crisis → Zero Mock Policy born
SDLC 4.7 (September 27, 2025)
  ↓ Battle-tested 5 pillars (HOW to build with excellence)
SDLC 4.8 (November 7, 2025)
  ↓ Design Thinking enhancement (WHAT to build that matters)
SDLC 4.9 (November 13, 2025)
  ↓ 10-Stage Complete Lifecycle (WHY → GOVERN full journey)
SDLC 4.9.1 (November 29, 2025)
  ↓ Code File Naming Standards Restored
SDLC 5.0.0 (December 5, 2025)
  ↓ Governance & Compliance + 4-Tier Classification + Industry Best Practices + Team Collaboration
```

### What SDLC 4.8 Gave Us (4 Core Stages - PRESERVED):
- ✅ **Stage 00 (WHY?)**: Foundation + Design Thinking EMPATHIZE + DEFINE
- ✅ **Stage 01 (WHAT?)**: Planning + Design Thinking IDEATE (start)
- ✅ **Stage 02 (HOW?)**: Design + Design Thinking IDEATE (complete)
- ✅ **Stage 03 (BUILD)**: Development + Design Thinking PROTOTYPE + TEST
- ✅ **Pillar 0**: Design Thinking Foundation (5 phases, 9 templates, NQH-Bot case study)
- ✅ **Pillars 1-5**: AI-Native Excellence (from SDLC 4.7)

### What SDLC 4.9 Added (6 Additional Stages) - RESTRUCTURED in 5.0.0:
- ➕ **Stage 03 (INTEGRATION)**: API Design & System Integration ← **MOVED from 07 in 5.0.0**
- ➕ **Stage 04 (BUILD)**: Development & Implementation ← Renumbered (was 03)
- ➕ **Stage 05 (TEST)**: Comprehensive quality validation and QA ← Renumbered (was 04)
- ➕ **Stage 06 (DEPLOY)**: Production go-live execution ← Renumbered (was 05)
- ➕ **Stage 07 (OPERATE)**: Sustain production excellence ← Renumbered (was 06)
- ➕ **Stage 08 (COLLABORATE)**: Effective team coordination and knowledge sharing
- ➕ **Stage 09 (GOVERN)**: Strategic oversight, compliance, and risk management

> **CEO Directive (Nov 13, 2025)**: "We need to clearly describe the relationship between WHY, WHAT, HOW, BUILD, and add DEPLOY, TEST, OPERATE to complete our core methodology."

This became the catalyst for **SDLC 4.9 enhancement** - expanding from 4 stages to a complete 10-stage lifecycle that maps perfectly to our enterprise documentation structure (/docs folders 00-09).

## 📊 10-Stage Complete Lifecycle Overview (SDLC 5.0.0 Restructured)

### CRITICAL RESTRUCTURE: INTEGRATE Moved from Stage 07 to Stage 03

**Rationale**: Contract-First principle - API Design must happen BEFORE coding begins:
- ISO/IEC 12207:2017 places Integration in Technical processes (before Operation)
- DevOps best practices: CI happens during Build, not post-production
- Practical logic: Cannot design APIs after system is in production

### Business Questions → SDLC Stages → Documentation Structure

## 🧠 PILLAR 0: Design Thinking Foundation (PRESERVED from 4.8)

**Birth Story**: November 2025 - Chairman identifies gap in methodology

**Chairman's Insight**:
> "Our methodology excels at building things right (quality, speed, AI collaboration), but we haven't highlighted how we ensure we build the RIGHT things (user empathy, problem validation)."

### The Problem Design Thinking Solves

**Traditional Software Development Waste**:
- 70% of features rarely or never used (Standish Group)
- 45% of features built are never used at all (Standish Group)
- Average project: 64% of features NOT essential (Standish Group)
- Root cause: **Building solutions before understanding problems**

**Design Thinking Changes This**:
```
Empathize (Understand users) →
Define (Frame right problem) →
Ideate (Generate solutions) →
Prototype (Build minimum testable) →
Test (Validate with users) →
Ship (Validated solution)
```

**Result**: Build features users actually need and use.

---

### Design Thinking 5 Phases (PRESERVED from 4.8)

#### Phase 1: EMPATHIZE 🧠
**Purpose**: Deeply understand users' pain, context, needs

**Activities**:
- User interviews (5-10 per persona)
- Journey mapping (visualize end-to-end experience)
- Empathy mapping (what users see, hear, think, feel)
- Observational research (watch users in real context)

**Deliverables**:
- User personas with evidence
- Pain points ranked by severity
- Journey maps showing emotional journey
- Empathy maps synthesizing insights

**Time**: 3-5 days (Week 1 of Stage 00)

**Tools**: [Empathy-Map-Canvas-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/1-AI-Tools/design-thinking/), [User-Journey-Map-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/)

**Example (NQH-Bot)**:
- Interviewed 10 restaurant managers
- Found: Problem is "loss of trust in data" (not "slow tracking")
- Impact: ₫15B revenue at risk, 60 hours/month wasted
- Insight: Emotional problem (anxiety) NOT functional problem (speed)

---

#### Phase 2: DEFINE 🎯
**Purpose**: Frame the RIGHT problem to solve

**Activities**:
- Problem statement creation (evidence-based, specific)
- POV (Point of View) statement (user + need + insight)
- "How Might We" questions (transform problems into opportunities)
- Success metrics definition (measurable outcomes)

**Deliverables**:
- Problem statement (validated with 3+ users)
- POV statement (functional + emotional + strategic)
- 20-50 HMW questions (clustered into themes)
- Success criteria (quantified)

**Time**: 2-3 days (End of Week 1 Stage 00 → Start of Stage 01)

**Tools**: [Problem-Statement-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/), [POV-Statement-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/), [HMW-Questions-Worksheet.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/)

**Example (NQH-Bot)**:
- Problem: "Managers cannot trust attendance data due to 5-10% manual errors"
- POV: "Managers need to FEEL confident in data (not just track faster)"
- HMWs: "How might we provide automatic verification without manager effort?"
- Metrics: 95% accuracy, <10 sec check-in, 90% trust score

---

#### Phase 3: IDEATE 💡
**Purpose**: Generate diverse solution ideas

**Activities**:
- Brainstorming sessions (100+ ideas target)
- SCAMPER technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, etc.)
- Analogies (borrow from other industries)
- Concept sketching (visualize top ideas)

**Deliverables**:
- 100+ raw ideas (quantity over quality)
- 10-15 idea themes (clustered)
- Top 3 concepts (voted by team)
- Concept sketches (high-level visuals)

**Time**: 3-4 days (Week 2 of Stage 01-02)

**Tools**: [Ideation-Brainstorming-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/)

**Example (NQH-Bot)**:
- Generated 154 ideas in 90-minute session
- Top concept: GPS + photo auto-verification (eliminates 45-min manual review)
- Key innovation: Automatic verification at SOURCE (staff check-in point)

---

#### Phase 4: PROTOTYPE 🛠️
**Purpose**: Build minimum testable version to learn

**Activities**:
- Fidelity selection (paper → digital → code → MVP)
- Paper prototyping (4 hours, test with 3 users)
- Digital mockup (1-3 days, Figma clickable prototype)
- Code prototype (1-2 weeks, working but not production-ready)

**Deliverables**:
- Paper prototype (if applicable)
- Digital mockup (Figma/XD/Sketch)
- Code prototype (working features, known limitations)
- Demo video (30-60 seconds)

**Time**: 5-7 days (Week 3 of Stage 03)

**Tools**: [Prototype-Test-Plan-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/)

**Example (NQH-Bot)**:
- Paper prototype: 4 hours, found navigation issues early
- Digital mockup: 3 days (Figma, 12 screens)
- Code prototype: 2 days (React Native + Firebase, installable app)
- Progression saved 2+ weeks vs building full solution first

---

#### Phase 5: TEST 🧪
**Purpose**: Validate with real users, iterate or pivot

**Activities**:
- User testing sessions (5-8 participants)
- Task completion measurement (time, errors, success rate)
- Qualitative feedback (quotes, observations, emotions)
- Assumption validation (confirm or invalidate hypotheses)

**Deliverables**:
- Test results (quantitative metrics)
- User feedback patterns (qualitative insights)
- Assumption validation report (what's true, what's false)
- Iteration plan OR ship decision

**Time**: 5-7 days (Week 4 of Stage 03)

**Tools**: [User-Testing-Script-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/), [Feedback-Analysis-Template.md](../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/)

**Example (NQH-Bot)**:
- Tested with 6 users (5 staff + 1 manager)
- Results: 100% check-in success, 8.2 sec avg time (under 10-sec target)
- Found 1 critical blocker: Battery anxiety (4/6 users concerned)
- Decision: ITERATE (fix blocker, retest, then ship)

### Design Thinking + Iceberg Model Integration (PRESERVED from 4.8)

**The Iceberg Model** (System Thinking - 4 Layers):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 1: EVENTS (Visible Symptoms)          │ ← Most developers work here
│   What: Problems as they appear              │
│   Approach: React and fix                    │
│   Example: "Attendance tracking is slow"     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 2: PATTERNS (Recurring Themes)        │ ← Traditional analysis
│   What: Trends over time                     │
│   Approach: Anticipate                       │
│   Example: "Managers spend 2 hours daily"    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 3: STRUCTURES (Systems/Processes)     │ ← DEFINE phase works here
│   What: Underlying systems causing patterns  │
│   Approach: Design solutions                 │
│   Example: "Manual process creates errors"   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 4: MENTAL MODELS (Beliefs/Assumptions)│ ← EMPATHIZE phase reaches here
│   What: Why systems exist (culture, beliefs) │
│   Approach: Transform thinking               │
│   Example: "Trust is broken" (emotional)     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Thinking Empathy connects to Layer 4**:
- Traditional development fixes Layer 1-2 (events, patterns)
- Design Thinking EMPATHIZE reaches Layer 4 (mental models, emotions)
- Result: Solve root problems, not symptoms

**Example (NQH-Bot)** - PRESERVED battle-tested wisdom:
```
Layer 1 (Event): "Attendance tracking is slow"
  → Traditional solution: Make faster tracking tool (doesn't work!)

Layer 2 (Pattern): "Managers spend 2 hours daily on tracking"
  → Traditional solution: Automate tracking (partial fix)

Layer 3 (Structure): "Manual process creates 5-10% errors"
  → Design solution: Automatic data capture (better!)

Layer 4 (Mental Model): "I don't trust the data anymore"
  → Design Thinking insight: Problem is TRUST, not SPEED
  → Solution: Build trust through verifiable proof (GPS + photo)
  → Result: 90% trust restoration (root problem solved!)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Fixing Layer 1-2: Temporary relief, problem returns
- Fixing Layer 3: Better system, but may miss real need
- Fixing Layer 4: Transform mental models, sustainable solution

---

### Design Thinking Quality Gates (PRESERVED from 4.8)

**Gate 0.1: Problem Definition** (After EMPATHIZE + DEFINE)

**Question**: "Have we defined the RIGHT problem?"

**Criteria**:
- ✅ Problem statement based on user empathy (evidence from 5+ interviews)
- ✅ Measurable success criteria defined (not vague)
- ✅ Team alignment (everyone can explain problem in user's words)
- ✅ User validation (read problem to 3 users, they confirm)

**Decision**:
- **PASS** → Proceed to IDEATE
- **FAIL** → Conduct more interviews, refine problem statement

**Red Flags**:
- Problem based on "we think" instead of "users said"
- No direct user quotes supporting problem
- Team members describe different problems
- Users say "that's not quite right" when hearing problem statement

---

**Gate 0.2: Solution Diversity** (After IDEATE)

**Question**: "Have we explored enough solution space?"

**Criteria**:
- ✅ Generated 100+ ideas (quantity ensures quality)
- ✅ Identified 10+ distinct themes (diversity)
- ✅ Included wild/crazy ideas (challenge assumptions)
- ✅ Top 3 concepts are solution-neutral (not locked into one approach)

**Decision**:
- **PASS** → Proceed to PROTOTYPE
- **FAIL** → Run additional ideation session

**Red Flags**:
- <50 ideas generated (insufficient exploration)
- All ideas similar (groupthink)
- Only "safe" incremental ideas (no breakthroughs)
- Team immediately locked onto one solution

---

**Gate 0.3: Prototype Fidelity** (After PROTOTYPE)

**Question**: "Did we build minimum to LEARN (not minimum to SHIP)?"

**Criteria**:
- ✅ Started at lowest fidelity (paper/sketches tested first)
- ✅ Built only features needed to test assumptions
- ✅ Known limitations documented
- ✅ Real users can test this (not just internal team)

**Decision**:
- **PASS** → Proceed to TEST
- **FAIL** → Reduce scope, lower fidelity, or clarify what to test

**Red Flags**:
- Jumped straight to code (skipped paper/digital)
- Built "complete" features (too much for prototype)
- Only testable by technical team (not real users)
- No clear assumptions to validate

---

**Gate 0.4: Test Validity** (After TEST)

**Question**: "Did we test with RIGHT USERS in RIGHT CONTEXT?"

**Criteria**:
- ✅ Tested with real users (not internal proxies)
- ✅ 5-8 participants (sufficient for qualitative insights)
- ✅ Tested in real context (not artificial lab)
- ✅ Captured both quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (quotes) data

**Decision**:
- **PASS** → Make ship/iterate/pivot decision
- **FAIL** → Recruit correct users, retest

**Red Flags**:
- Tested only with internal team
- <3 participants (insufficient sample)
- Lab testing for real-world product
- Only quantitative OR only qualitative (need both)

---

**Gate 0.5: Ship Decision** (After TEST Analysis)

**Question**: "Should we ship, iterate, or pivot?"

**Criteria**:

**SHIP** ✅:
- All critical assumptions validated
- Task completion rate >80%
- Users express strong positive sentiment
- No P0 blockers

**ITERATE** 🔄:
- Some assumptions validated, others need refinement
- Task completion rate 50-80%
- Mixed user sentiment
- P0 blockers identified but fixable in <2 weeks

**PIVOT** ❌:
- Critical assumptions proven false
- Task completion rate <50%
- Strong negative user sentiment
- Fundamental concept issues (not just UX fixes)

**Decision**:
- **SHIP** → Move to production build (Stage 03 full implementation → Stage 04 TEST)
- **ITERATE** → Fix issues, retest with 3-5 users, decide again
- **PIVOT** → Return to IDEATE, generate new concepts

---

---

### Pillar 4: Documentation Permanence
[Same as SDLC 4.7 - Enhanced in 4.9 with 10-stage /docs structure]

**Birth Story**: September 2025 - Document chaos with dates/versions/sprint numbers  
**Crisis That Shaped It**: 919 files renamed in NQH-Bot, documents becoming obsolete

**Key Components**:
- **Permanent Naming**: No dates/versions in filenames (versions inside documents)
- **AI-Parseable Formats**: Markdown, YAML, JSON (not PDFs, Word docs)
- **Feature-Based Naming**: Describe WHAT (not WHEN/WHO)
  - ✅ Good: `Authentication-Service-Architecture.md`
  - ❌ Bad: `SPRINT-7-Auth-V2-John-FINAL.md`
- **Universal Standards**: Applies to all projects, all teams

**4.9 Enhancement**: Perfect alignment with 10-stage framework:
```
10 SDLC Stages → 10 /docs Folders (00-09)
- Stage 00 (WHY) → 00-Project-Foundation/
- Stage 01 (WHAT) → 01-Planning-Analysis/
- ... (perfect 1:1 mapping)
- Stage 09 (GOVERN) → 09-Executive-Reports/
```

**Proven Results**:
- 919 files standardized (NQH-Bot platform)
- 100% discoverability (AI agents can parse)
- Zero obsolescence (names永久 relevant)

---

### Pillar 5: Continuous Compliance Platform
[Same as SDLC 4.7 - Enhanced in 4.9 with GOVERN stage]

**Birth Story**: September 2025 - Need for real-time compliance monitoring  
**Crisis That Shaped It**: 679 mock crisis, Vietnamese compliance requirements

**Key Components**:
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: <5 min detection of violations

- **Pre-commit Blocking**: Prevent violations before merge
- **Executive Dashboards**: CEO/CTO real-time visibility

**Vietnamese Compliance** (CRITICAL - exact requirements):
```yaml
Labor & Tax Compliance:
  - BHXH (Social Insurance): 17.5% employer, 8.0% employee (EXACT)
  - VAT (Value Added Tax): 10.0% standard rate (EXACT)
  - FIFO (Inventory): VAS 02 accounting standard
  - PIT (Personal Income Tax): Progressive rates

Cultural Requirements:
  - Authenticity: 96.4% minimum (measured via NQH-Bot)

## PART 2: THE 10-STAGE COMPLETE LIFECYCLE (SDLC 5.0.0 Restructured)

### Overview: From Discovery to Governance

SDLC 5.0.0 provides **complete lifecycle coverage** through 10 systematic stages, now categorized as **Linear** (sequential) and **Continuous** (ongoing). The critical change is moving **INTEGRATE from Stage 07 to Stage 03** for Contract-First alignment.

**The Journey (SDLC 5.0.0 Restructured)**:
```
LINEAR STAGES (Sequential):
00 foundation  → Why build this? (Foundation & Discovery)
01 planning    → What to build? (Planning & Requirements)
02 design      → How to build? (Architecture & Design)
03 integration → API contracts first (API Design & Integration) ← MOVED FROM 07
04 build       → Building it right (Development & Implementation)
05 test        → Validating quality (Quality Assurance & Validation)
06 deploy      → Shipping safely (Deployment & Release Management)
07 operate     → Running reliably (Operations & Monitoring)

CONTINUOUS STAGES (Ongoing throughout project):
08 collaborate → Coordinating teams (Team Coordination & Communication)
09 govern      → Maintaining compliance (Governance & Compliance)
```

**Key Principle**: Each stage has clear inputs, activities, outputs, and quality gates. Design Thinking (Pillar 0) applies throughout, System Thinking (Pillar 3) provides depth analysis, and all 6 Pillars support every stage.

**Critical Change in 5.0.0**: Stage 03 (integration) comes BEFORE Stage 04 (build) because API contracts must be defined before coding begins (Contract-First principle, ISO 12207 aligned).

---

### Stage 00: WHY - Foundation & Discovery
**Core Question**: Why are we building this? What problem does it solve?

**Purpose**: Establish clear business justification, validate problem-solution fit, and ensure alignment with organizational strategy before investing resources.

**Pillar 0 (Design Thinking) Application**:
- **Empathize**: Deep user research, pain point discovery
- **Define**: Clear problem statement, success criteria
- Quality Gate 0.1-0.2: Problem validated, solution direction confirmed

**Key Activities**:

1. **Problem Discovery**
   - User interviews (5-10 users minimum)
   - Pain point identification and quantification
   - Current state analysis (what exists today?)
   - Impact assessment (cost of NOT solving)

2. **Business Case Development**
   - ROI calculation (expected vs actual)
   - Resource requirements (team, budget, timeline)
   - Risk assessment (what could go wrong?)
   - Strategic alignment (how does this fit company vision?)

3. **Stakeholder Alignment**
   - Executive buy-in (CEO, CPO, CTO)
   - User validation (is this their top pain point?)
   - Team commitment (can we deliver this?)
   - Success metrics definition (how will we measure?)

**Deliverables**:
- Problem Statement (1-2 pages max)
- Business Case (ROI, resources, timeline)
- Success Metrics (measurable, time-bound)
- Stakeholder Approval (written sign-off)

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ Problem validated by 5+ users
- ✅ ROI > 3:1 minimum (BFlow achieved 827:1)
- ✅ Executive approval obtained
- ✅ Success metrics defined and agreed

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ❌ Building solutions looking for problems
- ❌ Skipping user validation ("we know what they need")
- ❌ Unclear success criteria
- ❌ No executive alignment

**BFlow Platform Example**:
- **Problem**: Vietnamese SMEs need affordable, compliant business management
- **Pain Point**: Existing solutions cost $50-200/user/month, no Vietnamese compliance
- **ROI**: 827:1 validated (Nov 1 - Dec 20, 2025, 52 days)
- **Success Metric**: 3 pilot customers, 99.9%+ uptime, <$10/user/month cost

**Time Investment**: 1-2 weeks (don't rush - this is foundation)

**Links to Other Stages**:
- → Stage 01 (WHAT): Validated problem becomes requirements
- → Stage 09 (GOVERN): Success metrics become KPIs for governance

---

### Stage 01: WHAT - Planning & Requirements
**Core Question**: What exactly will we build? What features are must-have vs nice-to-have?

**Purpose**: Transform validated problems into concrete, prioritized requirements with clear acceptance criteria.

**Pillar 0 (Design Thinking) Application**:
- **Ideate**: Generate solutions, prioritize features
- **Prototype**: Low-fidelity mockups, user flows
- Quality Gate 0.3: Solution validated, features prioritized

**Key Activities**:

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - User stories (As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit])
   - Feature prioritization (MoSCoW: Must/Should/Could/Won't)
   - Acceptance criteria (how will we know it's done?)
   - Edge cases identification (what could break?)

2. **Scope Definition**
   - MVP (Minimum Viable Product) definition
   - Phase 1/2/3 roadmap (what ships when?)
   - Dependencies mapping (what depends on what?)
   - Resource allocation (who builds what?)

3. **Validation & Refinement**
   - User feedback on mockups (do they love it?)
   - Technical feasibility check (can we build this?)
   - Risk mitigation (how do we handle unknowns?)
   - Timeline estimation (how long will this take?)

**Deliverables**:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD) - 10-20 pages
- User stories with acceptance criteria (20-50 stories)
- Prioritized feature list (MoSCoW method)
- Low-fidelity prototypes (Figma/Sketch)
- Technical feasibility assessment

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ 100% of must-have features have acceptance criteria
- ✅ 5+ users validated prototype (75%+ approval)
- ✅ Technical team confirms feasibility
- ✅ Resource allocation approved

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ❌ Feature creep (trying to build everything)
- ❌ Unclear acceptance criteria ("make it pretty")
- ❌ No user validation of requirements
- ❌ Underestimating technical complexity

**BFlow Platform Example**:
- **Must-Have**: Multi-tenant SaaS, BHXH compliance, Vietnamese NLU
- **Should-Have**: Mobile app, offline mode, AI insights
- **Could-Have**: Advanced analytics, API marketplace
- **Won't Have** (Phase 1): International expansion, blockchain integration
- **Validation**: 10 SMEs reviewed mockups, 90% approval rate

**Time Investment**: 2-3 weeks (includes user validation cycles)

**Links to Other Stages**:
- ← Stage 00 (WHY): Builds on validated problem statement
- → Stage 02 (HOW): Requirements become architecture inputs

---

### Stage 02: HOW - Architecture & Design
**Core Question**: How will we architect and design the solution? What technologies and patterns?

**Purpose**: Design scalable, maintainable, secure architecture that can support current requirements and future growth.

**Pillar 0 (Design Thinking) Application**:
- **Prototype**: High-fidelity designs, technical proof-of-concepts
- Quality Gate 0.4: Architecture validated, design approved

**Key Activities**:

1. **Architecture Design**
   - System architecture (monolith/microservices/hybrid?)
   - Technology stack selection (proven vs cutting-edge?)
   - Data architecture (database schema, relationships)
   - Security architecture (authentication, authorization, encryption)
   - Scalability plan (how will this scale to 10x/100x users?)

2. **Technical Decisions**
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - document key choices
   - Trade-off analysis (speed vs quality, cost vs features)
   - Risk assessment (what are technical risks?)
   - Dependency management (what external services needed?)

3. **Design System**
   - UI/UX design system (components, patterns, guidelines)
   - Design-to-code workflow (Figma → React components)
   - Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
   - Performance budgets (<50ms API, <2s page load)

**Deliverables**:
- Architecture diagrams (C4 model: Context, Container, Component, Code)
- Technology stack documentation (with justification)
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) - 5-10 key decisions
- High-fidelity UI designs (Figma/Sketch)
- Database schema (ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram)
- API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Security model documentation

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ CTO approval of architecture
- ✅ Security review passed
- ✅ Scalability validated (load testing plan)
- ✅ Design system approved by users (80%+ satisfaction)

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ❌ Over-engineering (building for 1M users when you have 10)
- ❌ Technology resume-driven development ("let's use the hot new framework")
- ❌ No ADRs (why did we make this choice?)
- ❌ Skipping security architecture

**BFlow Platform Example**:
- **Architecture**: Hybrid (Django monolith + microservices for AI/integrations)
- **Stack**: Python/Django, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery
- **Scalability**: Multi-tenant (row-level), horizontal scaling ready
- **Security**: OAuth2, row-level security, encryption at rest
- **ADRs**: 12 documented decisions (including why hybrid architecture)
- **Performance**: <50ms API response, <2s page load validated

**Time Investment**: 2-4 weeks (includes proof-of-concepts)

**Links to Other Stages**:
- ← Stage 01 (WHAT): Requirements inform architecture
- → Stage 03 (BUILD): Architecture becomes implementation guide
- → Stage 07 (INTEGRATE): Integration patterns defined here

---

### Stage 03: INTEGRATION - API Design & System Integration 🔄 MOVED FROM STAGE 07
**Core Question**: What APIs do we need? How will systems connect?

**Purpose**: Define API contracts, integration patterns, and system interoperability BEFORE coding begins (Contract-First principle).

**Why Stage 03 (Not Stage 07 in previous versions)**:
- **ISO 12207 Alignment**: Integration belongs in Technical processes (before Operation)
- **Contract-First**: OpenAPI specs must exist before implementation
- **DevOps CI**: Continuous Integration happens during Build, not post-production
- **Practical Logic**: Cannot design APIs after system is in production

**Key Activities**:

1. **API Contract Design (Contract-First)**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specification writing (before any code)
   - RESTful API design (resource-oriented, HTTP verbs)
   - GraphQL schema design (for complex data requirements)
   - gRPC protobuf definitions (for high-performance services)
   - API versioning strategy (v1, v2, backward compatibility)

2. **Integration Architecture**
   - **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point design (Kong, AWS API Gateway)
   - **Service Mesh**: Service-to-service communication patterns (Istio, Linkerd)
   - **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication design (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis)
   - **Event-Driven**: Event sourcing, CQRS patterns
   - **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns (prevent cascade failures)

3. **Third-Party Integration Planning**
   - External API integration mapping (payment, auth, cloud services)
   - Webhook design (incoming and outgoing)
   - Data transformation patterns (ETL, data normalization)
   - Rate limiting strategy (prevent abuse)
   - Authentication flow design (OAuth2, JWT tokens)

4. **Contract Testing Strategy**
   - Consumer-driven contract tests (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract)
   - Mock server generation from OpenAPI specs
   - Integration test environment setup
   - CI/CD contract validation pipeline

**Deliverables**:
- OpenAPI specifications (complete, validated)
- Integration architecture diagrams
- API versioning documentation
- Third-party integration inventory
- Contract testing strategy document
- Message queue / event schema definitions
- Error handling strategy (retry, circuit breaker patterns)

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ OpenAPI specs complete and validated (linting passed)
- ✅ All external integrations documented
- ✅ Contract tests defined for all APIs
- ✅ API versioning strategy approved
- ✅ Security review of API design passed

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ❌ Designing APIs during/after coding (leads to inconsistent contracts)
- ❌ No API versioning (breaking changes affect all clients)
- ❌ Synchronous-only design (cascading failures risk)
- ❌ Missing error handling patterns (retry, circuit breaker)
- ❌ No contract validation in CI/CD

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ 95%+ test cases passed
- ✅ Zero critical bugs
- ✅ Performance targets met (<50ms API, <2s page load)
- ✅ Security scans passed (no critical vulnerabilities)
- ✅ UAT satisfaction > 80%

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ❌ Skipping UAT ("we tested it ourselves")
- ❌ No performance testing (scaling surprises in production)
- ❌ Ignoring security testing (vulnerabilities discovered by hackers)
- ❌ Testing only happy paths (edge cases break production)

**BFlow Platform Example**:
- **E2E Testing**: 150+ test cases covering all user journeys
- **Performance**: Load tested with 1,000 concurrent users, <45ms average
- **Security**: Quarterly penetration testing, OWASP Top 10 compliance
- **UAT**: 10 pilot users, 94% satisfaction before go-live
- **Result**: 99.9%+ uptime in production (Dec 15-20 soft launch)

**Time Investment**: 2-4 weeks (parallel with late-stage development)

**Links to Other Stages**:
- ← Stage 04 (BUILD): Tests what was built
- → Stage 06 (DEPLOY): Only deploy if tests pass
- → Stage 07 (OPERATE): Test results inform monitoring

---

### Stage 06: DEPLOY - Deployment & Release Management
**Core Question**: How do we ship safely? With zero downtime and rollback capability?

**Purpose**: Deploy to production safely, with automated processes, monitoring, and the ability to rollback if issues arise.

**Note in SDLC 5.0.0**: Shifted from Stage 05 to Stage 06 due to INTEGRATION moving to Stage 03.

### ~~Stage 07: INTEGRATE~~ - MOVED TO STAGE 03 in SDLC 5.0.0

> **NOTE**: In SDLC 5.0.0, the INTEGRATE stage has been **moved from Stage 07 to Stage 03** to ensure Contract-First development (API specs before coding). See **Stage 03: INTEGRATION** for full details.

**Rationale for Move**:
- **ISO 12207 Alignment**: Integration belongs in Technical processes (before Operation)
- **Contract-First**: OpenAPI specs must exist before implementation
- **DevOps CI**: Continuous Integration happens during Build, not post-production
- **Practical Logic**: Cannot design APIs after system is in production

The following content is preserved for reference but is no longer the canonical Stage 07.
