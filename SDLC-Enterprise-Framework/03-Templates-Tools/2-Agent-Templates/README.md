## 📊 Multi-Agent Coordination (ENTERPRISE)

### Pattern 1: Sequential Pipeline

```
Stage 00-01: Business Analyst → Product Owner → CEO approval
Stage 02: Architect → CTO review
Stage 03: Developer → QA review
Stage 04: QA Engineer → Developer fixes
Stage 05: DevOps → Production
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Development

```
Team A: Developer A + QA A → Feature A
Team B: Developer B + QA B → Feature B
Integration: Architect + DevOps → Integration tests
```

### Pattern 3: Executive Oversight

```
Daily: Developer + QA (implementation)
Weekly: Architect + CTO (architecture review)
Sprint: CPO + CEO (strategic validation)
```

### Coordination Rules

✅ **DO:**
- Define clear boundaries between agents
- Document handoff points
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Review `AI-TOOLS-COORDINATION-BEST-PRACTICES.md`

❌ **DON'T:**
- Overlap agent responsibilities
- Skip handoff documentation
- Use conflicting standards
- Ignore stage gates
