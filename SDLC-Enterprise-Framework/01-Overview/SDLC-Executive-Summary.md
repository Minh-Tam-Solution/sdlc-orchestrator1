## 🚀 What's New in SDLC 5.0.0 (December 6, 2025)

### Stage Restructuring: INTEGRATION → Stage 03 (CRITICAL)

**SDLC 5.0.0** moves **INTEGRATION from Stage 07 to Stage 03** to enforce Contract-First development:

```yaml
Why This Change?
  Problem: In 4.x, INTEGRATE was Stage 07 (after OPERATE)
  Issue: Cannot design APIs after system is in production
  Solution: Move INTEGRATION to Stage 03, BEFORE BUILD (Stage 04)

New Stage Order (Linear 00-07, Continuous 08-09):
  00-foundation    # WHY - Problem Definition
  01-planning      # WHAT - Requirements
  02-design        # HOW - Architecture
  03-integration   # API Design (MOVED FROM 07) ← Contract-First
  04-build         # Development
  05-test          # Quality Assurance
  06-deploy        # Release
  07-operate       # Production
  08-collaborate   # Team (Continuous)
  09-govern        # Compliance (Continuous)

Industry Alignment:
  - ISO/IEC 12207: Integration in Technical processes (before Operation)
  - DevOps CI: Continuous Integration during Build, not post-production
  - NIST SSDF: Secure design before implementation
```

### Governance & Compliance Standards

**SDLC 5.0.0** introduces comprehensive Governance & Compliance standards integrated into `02-Core-Methodology`:

```yaml
New Documents:
  - SDLC-Quality-Gates.md     # DORA metrics, test coverage, code quality
  - SDLC-Security-Gates.md    # OWASP ASVS, SBOM, SAST/DAST, threat modeling
  - SDLC-Observability-Checklist.md  # Metrics, logs, traces, alerting
  - SDLC-Change-Management-Standard.md  # CAB process, rollback, risk scoring
```

### 4-Tier Classification System (NEW)

| Tier | Team Size | Documentation Required | Quality Gates |
|------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **LITE** | 1-2 | README + .env.example | Basic |
| **STANDARD** | 3-10 | + CLAUDE.md + /docs | + Security Gates |
| **PROFESSIONAL** | 10-50 | + Full 10-stage /docs + ADRs | + Observability + DORA |
| **ENTERPRISE** | 50+ | + Weekly CTO/CPO Reports | + Full Compliance + Audit |

### Industry Best Practices Integration

```yaml
Standards Integrated:
  - CMMI v3.0: Maturity levels mapped to 4 tiers
  - DORA Metrics: Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, CFR
  - SAFe 6.0: Lean Governance concepts
  - OWASP ASVS: Level 1-3 security requirements
  - Team Topologies: 4 fundamental team types
  - NIST SSDF: Secure development practices
  - ISO/IEC 12207: Process group alignment
```

## 📋 What's New in SDLC 4.9.1 (November 29, 2025)

### Code File Naming Standards Restored

**SDLC 4.9.1** restores the Code File Naming Standards from SDLC 4.3/4.4 that were accidentally omitted in 4.9.0:

```yaml
Code File Naming Standards:
  Python Files:     snake_case, max 50 chars (user_service.py)
  TypeScript Files: camelCase, max 50 chars (arService.ts)
  React Components: PascalCase, max 50 chars (ARDashboard.tsx)
```

**Documentation**: [02-Core-Methodology/Documentation-Standards/SDLC-Code-File-Naming-Standards.md](../02-Core-Methodology/Documentation-Standards/SDLC-Code-File-Naming-Standards.md)

## 🚀 What's New in SDLC 4.9 (November 2025)

### From 4-Stage to 10-Stage Complete Methodology

**SDLC 4.9 is a MAJOR ENHANCEMENT of SDLC 4.8**, expanding from 4 core stages to a complete 10-stage lifecycle that covers the entire software development journey from strategic foundation to production excellence.

**The Evolution Journey**:
```
SDLC 1.0 (June 2025)
  ↓ CEO + Claude Code collaboration begins
SDLC 3.x (July 2025)
  ↓ BFlow Platform teaches System Thinking
SDLC 4.7 (September 2025)
  ↓ Battle-tested 5 pillars (HOW to build with excellence)
SDLC 4.8 (November 7, 2025)
  ↓ Design Thinking enhancement (WHAT to build that matters)
SDLC 4.9 (November 13, 2025)
  ↓ 10-Stage Complete Lifecycle (WHY → GOVERN full cycle)
SDLC 4.9.1 (November 29, 2025)
  ↓ Code File Naming Standards Restored (consistency enforcement)
SDLC 5.0.0 (December 5, 2025)
  ↓ Governance & Compliance + 4-Tier System + Industry Standards
```

**What SDLC 4.8 Gave Us** (4 Core Stages):
- ✅ **WHY** (Foundation): Strategic vision and problem validation
- ✅ **WHAT** (Planning): Requirements and scope definition
- ✅ **HOW** (Design): Technical architecture and design
- ✅ **BUILD** (Development): Implementation with AI+Human orchestration

**What SDLC 4.9 Adds** (6 Additional Stages):
- ➕ **TEST** (Quality): Comprehensive validation and QA
- ➕ **DEPLOY** (Go-Live): Production deployment execution
- ➕ **OPERATE** (Production): Sustain production excellence
- ➕ **INTEGRATE** (APIs/Systems): Seamless service integration
- ➕ **COLLABORATE** (Team): Effective coordination and knowledge sharing
- ➕ **GOVERN** (Oversight): Strategic reporting, compliance, and risk management

> **CEO Feedback (Nov 13, 2025)**: "We need to clearly describe the relationship between WHY, WHAT, HOW, BUILD, and add DEPLOY, TEST, OPERATE to complete our core methodology."

This became the catalyst for **SDLC 4.9 enhancement** - expanding from 4 stages to a complete 10-stage methodology that maps perfectly to our enterprise documentation structure.

### Why INTEGRATION Moved to Stage 03 (Contract-First Principle)

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **ISO 12207 Alignment** | Integration belongs in Technical processes (before Operation) |
| **Contract-First** | OpenAPI specs must exist BEFORE coding begins |
| **DevOps CI** | Continuous Integration happens during Build, not post-production |
| **Practical Logic** | Cannot design APIs after system is already in production |

---

#### **Stage 03: INTEGRATION - API Design & System Integration** 🆕 *MOVED FROM STAGE 07*

**Purpose**: Define API contracts, integration patterns, and system interoperability BEFORE coding begins (Contract-First principle)

> **WHY Stage 03?** In previous SDLC versions, INTEGRATE was Stage 07 (post-OPERATE). This was logically incorrect - you cannot design APIs after the system is in production. SDLC 5.0.0 corrects this by placing INTEGRATION before BUILD.

**Key Activities**:

1. **API Contract Design (Contract-First)**:
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specification writing (before any code)
   - RESTful API design (resource-oriented, HTTP verbs)
   - GraphQL schema design (for complex data requirements)
   - gRPC protobuf definitions (for high-performance services)
   - API versioning strategy (v1, v2, backward compatibility)

2. **Integration Architecture**:
   - **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point design (Kong, AWS API Gateway)
   - **Service Mesh**: Service-to-service communication patterns (Istio, Linkerd)
   - **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication design (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis)
   - **Event-Driven**: Event sourcing, CQRS patterns
   - **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns (prevent cascade failures)

3. **Third-Party Integration Planning**:
   - External API integration mapping (payment, auth, cloud services)
   - Webhook design (incoming and outgoing)
   - Data transformation patterns (ETL, data normalization)
   - Rate limiting strategy (prevent abuse)
   - Authentication flow design (OAuth2, JWT tokens)

4. **Contract Testing Strategy**:
   - Consumer-driven contract tests (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract)
   - Mock server generation from OpenAPI specs
   - Integration test environment setup
   - CI/CD contract validation pipeline

**BFlow Example**: `/docs/03-integration/`
- OpenAPI: 1,629 lines, 30+ endpoints documented
- OAuth2: 265,000 req/s capacity planned
- Integrations: BHXH, VAT, Payment gateways, SMS/Email
- Message Queue: Kafka for event-driven architecture

**Deliverables**:
- OpenAPI specifications (complete, validated)
- Integration architecture diagrams
- API versioning documentation
- Third-party integration inventory
- Contract testing strategy document
- Message queue / event schema definitions
- Error handling strategy (retry, circuit breaker patterns)

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ API contracts validated with all consumers
- ✅ OpenAPI spec complete (100% endpoints documented)
- ✅ Integration architecture reviewed (CTO sign-off)
- ✅ Third-party dependencies risk-assessed
- ✅ Contract tests written for all critical APIs

**Time Investment**: 1-2 weeks (BEFORE BUILD stage)

---

#### **Stage 04: BUILD - Development & Implementation** ✅ *RENUMBERED FROM STAGE 03*

**Purpose**: Implementation with AI+Human orchestration, following API contracts from Stage 03

**Key Activities**:
1. **Design Thinking Integration**:
   - Phase 4: PROTOTYPE (build) - working code prototype
   - Phase 5: TEST (start) - initial validation with team

2. **Code Implementation**:
   - Backend development (FastAPI, Django, microservices)
   - Frontend development (React, TypeScript, UI components)
   - **Contract Implementation** (following OpenAPI specs from Stage 03)
   - Database migrations (Alembic, Django migrations)

3. **AI+Human Orchestration** (Pillar 2):
   - Claude Code: Architecture and complex logic
   - Cursor Pro: Real-time code assistance
   - Copilot: Code completion and patterns
   - ChatGPT: Documentation and test generation
   - Gemini: Code review and optimization

4. **Quality Integration**:
   - Unit testing (80%+ coverage target)
   - Integration testing (70%+ coverage target)
   - **Contract validation** (responses match OpenAPI specs)
   - Code review (peer review, AI-assisted)
   - CI/CD pipeline (automated testing, deployment)

**BFlow Example**: `/docs/04-build/`
- Implementation: OAuth2 Provider (265K req/s capacity)
- Stack: FastAPI + Django + PostgreSQL + Redis + Kafka
- Value: $6.23M (infrastructure + OAuth2 A+ 103%)

**Deliverables**:
- Production code (clean, maintainable, documented)
- Unit tests (80%+ coverage)
- Integration tests (70%+ coverage)
- CI/CD pipeline (automated, green builds)
- Code review reports (peer-reviewed)

**Quality Gates**:
- **G0.3: Prototype Fidelity**
  - ✅ Minimum to learn (not minimum to ship)
  - ✅ Core workflow functional
  - ✅ API responses match contracts from Stage 03
- **G0.4: Test Validity**
