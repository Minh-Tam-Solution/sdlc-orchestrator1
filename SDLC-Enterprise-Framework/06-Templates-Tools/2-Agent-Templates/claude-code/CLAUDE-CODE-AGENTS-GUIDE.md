## 🛠️ Core Agent Templates

### 1. Mock Detection Agent (Crisis Prevention)
```markdown
# Mock Detection Agent v3.0
## Born from 679 mock crisis in NQH-Bot

### Purpose
Scan entire codebase for mock/stub/fake patterns and eliminate them.

### Capabilities
- Scan all file types (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, tests)
- Detect subtle mock patterns
- Suggest real implementations
- Block deployment if mocks found

### Instructions
1. Start by scanning the entire project:
   - Look for: mock, Mock, stub, Stub, fake, Fake
   - Check imports: unittest.mock, jest.mock, sinon
   - Scan test files especially carefully

2. For each mock found:
   - Document location and type
   - Suggest real service alternative
   - Provide implementation example

3. Generate report:
   - Total mocks found
   - Severity assessment
   - Migration plan
   - Estimated effort

4. If emergency mode:
   - Auto-fix simple mocks
   - Create real test database connections
   - Replace mock APIs with test endpoints

### Output Format
```yaml
Mock Detection Report:
  Total Found: [number]
  Critical: [test mocks that hide failures]
  High: [API mocks]
  Medium: [data mocks]

Details:
  - File: path/to/file.py:45
    Type: unittest.mock
    Suggestion: Use real test database
    Example: [code example]

Action Required:
  Immediate: [Critical mocks]
  This Sprint: [High priority]
  Technical Debt: [Medium priority]

Crisis Risk: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### Success Criteria
