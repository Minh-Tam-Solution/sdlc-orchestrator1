# 🛠️ Prototype & Test Plan Template

**Purpose**: Build minimum testable version to validate assumptions quickly
**When to Use**: PROTOTYPE → TEST phases (SDLC Stage 03 - BUILD)
**Time Required**: 1-4 weeks (depending on fidelity)
**Participants**: Designer, developer, product manager

---

## 📋 How to Use This Template

1. **Select concept from ideation** - Focus on ONE concept (not all ideas)
2. **Choose appropriate fidelity** - Paper → Digital → Code (start lowest)
3. **Define what to learn** - What assumptions are we testing?
4. **Build minimum to test** - Not production-ready, just learn-ready
5. **Test with 5-8 real users** - Iterate based on feedback

---

## 🎯 PROTOTYPE PLANNING

### Concept to Prototype:

```yaml
Concept Name: [From ideation session]
One-Sentence Description: [What is this concept?]
User Need It Addresses: [From POV statement]
Key Innovation: [What's new/different about this?]
```

**Example (NQH-Bot)**:
```yaml
Concept Name: TrustCheck - Auto-Verify Attendance
One-Sentence Description: Staff check in via smartphone with GPS + photo verification
User Need It Addresses: Managers need to trust attendance data without manual verification
Key Innovation: Automatic verification at source (GPS + photo + timestamp) eliminates 45-minute manager review
```

---

### Critical Assumptions to Test:

**List 3-5 assumptions that, if wrong, would invalidate the concept**

```yaml
Assumption 1: [What must be true for this to work?]
  Test: [How will we validate this assumption?]
  Success Criteria: [What result confirms assumption?]

Assumption 2: [What must be true for this to work?]
  Test: [How will we validate this assumption?]
  Success Criteria: [What result confirms assumption?]

Assumption 3: [What must be true for this to work?]
  Test: [How will we validate this assumption?]
  Success Criteria: [What result confirms assumption?]
```

**Example (NQH-Bot)**:
```yaml
Assumption 1: Staff have smartphones and will use them for check-in
  Test: Interview 10 staff - do they have smartphones? Will they use work app?
  Success Criteria: 8/10 staff have smartphones, 7/10 willing to use app

Assumption 2: GPS accuracy is sufficient to verify location (restaurant vs competitor)
  Test: Test GPS at 3 restaurant locations, measure accuracy within 50m
  Success Criteria: GPS accurate to within 50m in 9/10 tests

Assumption 3: Photo check-in feels trustworthy (not surveillance) to staff
  Test: Show prototype to 5 staff, ask "Does this feel like surveillance or transparency?"
  Success Criteria: 4/5 staff say "transparency" not "surveillance"

Assumption 4: Managers trust auto-verification more than manual process
  Test: Show side-by-side (current vs prototype) to 3 managers
  Success Criteria: 3/3 managers prefer automated verification

Assumption 5: One-tap check-in takes <10 seconds (not burdensome)
  Test: Time 10 staff using prototype, measure check-in duration
  Success Criteria: Average <10 seconds, 9/10 complete successfully
```

## 📐 FIDELITY DECISION

### Choose Prototype Fidelity Level:

**Fidelity** = How close to final product (functionality + visual polish)

| Fidelity | Time to Build | Cost | Best For | Example |
|----------|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| **Paper** | 1-4 hours | Free | Concept validation, early ideas | Hand-drawn UI on paper |
| **Digital Mockup** | 1-3 days | Low | Flow validation, visual design | Figma clickable prototype |
| **Code Prototype** | 1-2 weeks | Medium | Technical feasibility, real data | Working app (limited features) |
| **MVP** | 4-12 weeks | High | Market validation, early adopters | Shippable product (core features) |

**Decision Framework**:

```
Use PAPER if:
  - First time testing concept
  - Validating flow / information architecture
  - Need feedback in <1 week
  - Budget is $0

Use DIGITAL MOCKUP if:
  - Concept validated on paper
  - Need realistic visual design
  - Testing interaction patterns
  - Budget is <$1,000

Use CODE PROTOTYPE if:
  - Digital mockup validated
  - Technical feasibility questions exist
  - Need to test with real data
  - Budget is $1,000-$10,000

Use MVP if:
  - Code prototype validated
  - Ready for market testing
  - Need to test business model (pricing, retention)
  - Budget is $10,000+
```

**Our Prototype Fidelity**: [Paper / Digital / Code / MVP]

**Rationale**: [Why this fidelity level?]

## 🛠️ PROTOTYPE BUILD PLAN

### Paper Prototype (1-4 hours):

```yaml
Materials Needed:
  - Blank paper or index cards
  - Markers/pens
  - Scissors (for movable elements)
  - Optional: Templates (smartphone frame, browser window)

Build Process:
  1. Sketch key screens (one screen per card)
  2. Draw interactive elements (buttons, forms, menus)
  3. Create movable pieces (dropdowns, modals)
  4. Number cards in order of flow
  5. Practice "playing" the prototype (facilitator moves cards)

Time: 1-4 hours
```

**Example (NQH-Bot - Paper Prototype)**:
```
Card 1: Login Screen
  - App logo
  - "Check In" button
  - "View My Hours" button

Card 2: Check-In Screen
  - Live camera preview (draw rectangle)
  - "Location: Restaurant B ✅" (GPS status)
  - "Tap to Check In" button
  - Current time display

Card 3: Confirmation Screen
  - Checkmark icon
  - "Checked in at 7:32am"
  - Photo thumbnail
  - "View My Hours" button

Card 4: Hours Dashboard
  - Calendar view with check-ins
  - Daily total hours
  - Week total
  - "Export" button
```

---

### Digital Mockup (1-3 days):

```yaml
Tool: [Figma / Adobe XD / Sketch / Balsamiq]

Build Process:
  1. Create wireframes (low-fidelity screens)
  2. Add content (real text, not lorem ipsum)
  3. Create interaction prototypes (click to next screen)
  4. Add transitions (optional, helps realism)
  5. Share prototype link for testing

Deliverables:
  - Figma/XD file with 5-15 screens
  - Clickable prototype link
  - Design notes (context for developers)

Time: 1-3 days
```

**Example (NQH-Bot - Digital Mockup)**:
```
Figma Prototype Structure:
  Screen 1: Splash / Login
  Screen 2: Home Dashboard
  Screen 3: Check-In Flow
    - 3a: Camera preview
    - 3b: GPS verification
    - 3c: Confirmation
  Screen 4: Hours History
  Screen 5: Manager Dashboard (if testing manager view)

Interactions:
  - "Check In" button → Screen 3a (camera)
  - Camera capture → Screen 3b (GPS verification)
  - "Confirm" → Screen 3c (success)
  - "View Hours" → Screen 4 (history)

Design Notes:
  - Use Vietnamese language (primary language)
  - Large touch targets (minimum 44px, F&B workers may wear gloves)
  - High contrast (outdoor visibility, bright sunlight)
  - Simple navigation (staff are not tech-savvy)
```

  - All critical assumptions confirmed
  - Task completion rate >80%
  - Users express strong positive sentiment
  - No critical usability issues
  → Next: Build MVP for market launch

🔄 ITERATE (if partially validated)
  - Some assumptions confirmed, others need refinement
  - Task completion rate 50-80%
  - Mixed user sentiment
  - Medium usability issues identified
  → Next: Fix issues, test again with 3-5 users

❌ PIVOT (if invalidated)
  - Critical assumptions proven false
  - Task completion rate <50%
  - Strong negative user sentiment
  - Fundamental concept issues
  → Next: Return to ideation, generate new concepts

⏸️ PAUSE (if unclear)
  - Results inconclusive
  - Need different user segment
  - External blockers (technical, business)
  → Next: Refine test plan, recruit different users
```

## 🤖 AI ASSISTANCE TIPS

**Use Claude/ChatGPT to**:
- Generate test tasks based on user stories
- Synthesize findings from test session notes
- Suggest improvements based on user feedback
- Draft test scripts and interview questions

**Prompt Example**:
```
I conducted 6 user tests of our attendance app prototype. Here are the notes:

[Paste raw notes from 6 sessions]

Please help me:
1. Identify top 3 patterns (issues mentioned by 3+ users)
2. Extract 5 most impactful direct quotes
3. Categorize findings by severity (critical/high/medium/low)
4. Suggest 3-5 specific improvements to address critical issues
5. Recommend: Should we ship, iterate, or pivot?
```

**Warning**: AI can help synthesize, but cannot replace observing real users. Always test with humans.

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Start with Lowest Fidelity
> "Don't code what you can mockup. Don't mockup what you can sketch. Start paper, increase fidelity only when validated."

### Tip 2: Test with Real Users in Real Context
> "Test attendance app at real restaurant during shift change. Context matters. Lab testing misses critical insights."

### Tip 3: Observe, Don't Lead
> "Don't say 'Click here'. Say 'How would you check in?' Let them struggle - that's where you learn."

### Tip 4: Iterate After Every 3-5 Users
> "Don't wait for all 8 tests. Fix critical issues after 3 users, test improved version with remaining 5."

### Tip 5: Build Minimum to Learn (Not Minimum to Ship)
> "Prototype goal is learning, not launching. Throw away 50% of prototype features after testing."

---

## 📚 NEXT STEPS

### After Prototype Testing:

1. **Synthesize Findings** → [Feedback-Analysis-Template.md](Feedback-Analysis-Template.md)
   - Analyze test results
   - Identify patterns

2. **Decide: Ship, Iterate, or Pivot**
   - Present findings to stakeholders
   - Make go/no-go decision

3. **If ITERATE**: Fix issues, test again
4. **If SHIP**: Build MVP for market launch
5. **If PIVOT**: Return to ideation phase
