# 📋 MTS SDLC Framework - CHANGELOG

## Complete Version History and Upgrade Documentation

**Framework**: SDLC 5.0.0 Enterprise Framework - WHY → GOVERN + Tiered Governance
**Maintained By**: CEO + CPO + CTO Leadership
**Last Updated**: December 5, 2025 (SDLC 5.0.0 Complete)

---

## 🚀 Version 5.0.0 - December 5, 2025 (MAJOR RELEASE)

**Release Date**: December 5, 2025
**Type**: MAJOR RELEASE - Contract-First Stage Restructuring + 4-Tier Classification + ISO 12207 Alignment
**Status**: PRODUCTION-READY
**Breaking Changes**: Yes - Stage numbering changed (INTEGRATE moved from 07 → 03)
**Supersedes**: SDLC 4.9.1 Complete 10-Stage Lifecycle
**Achievement**: Contract-First development with logical stage ordering + Universal governance for ALL project sizes

### 🎯 CRITICAL CHANGE: Contract-First Stage Restructuring

**THE PROBLEM**: Stage 07 (INTEGRATE) placed after Stage 06 (OPERATE) was logically incorrect:
- If a project is already in OPERATE (production), it cannot "go back" to define API contracts
- Integration/API Design belongs in the Design phase, not post-production
- This contradicted ISO/IEC 12207:2017 and DevOps best practices

**THE SOLUTION**: Move INTEGRATE from Stage 07 → Stage 03 (Contract-First principle)

```yaml
# SDLC 5.0.0 Stage Structure (Contract-First Order)

LINEAR STAGES (Sequential per release):
  00-foundation:   WHY - Problem Definition
  01-planning:     WHAT - Requirements Analysis
  02-design:       HOW - Architecture Design
  03-integration:  API Design & System Integration     ← MOVED FROM 07 (Contract-First)
  04-build:        Development & Implementation        ← Was 03
  05-test:         Quality Assurance                   ← Was 04
  06-deploy:       Release & Deployment                ← Was 05
  07-operate:      Production & Operations             ← Was 06

CONTINUOUS STAGES (Ongoing throughout project):
  08-collaborate:  Team Coordination & Communication
  09-govern:       Governance & Compliance
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **Contract-First**: API Design (OpenAPI specs) must happen BEFORE coding begins
- **ISO/IEC 12207:2017 Alignment**: Integration belongs with Technical processes (pre-operation)
- **DevOps CI**: Continuous Integration occurs during Build, not post-production
- **Practical Logic**: Cannot design APIs after system is in production

### 🎯 Key Enhancement: 4-Tier Governance Framework

  - 50% of governance effort wasted

After (Tiered Governance):
  - LITE: 90% less overhead (focus on building)
  - STANDARD: Right-size governance (efficient)
  - PROFESSIONAL: Complete coverage (quality)
  - ENTERPRISE: Full compliance (audit-ready)
  - 70% efficiency improvement in governance
```

### 🔄 Upgrade Process (4.9.1 → 5.0.0)

**Duration**: 4-6 hours (systematic upgrade)
**Approach**: Document-by-document with CPO/CTO review

**sdlcctl migrate Command** (RECOMMENDED):
```bash
# Auto-migrate project to SDLC 5.0.0 (includes stage restructuring)
sdlcctl migrate --from 4.9.1 --to 5.0.0 --path /path/to/project

# Preview changes only (dry-run)
sdlcctl migrate --from 4.9.1 --to 5.0.0 --path /path/to/project --dry-run

# Validate after migration
sdlcctl validate --path /path/to/project
```

**Manual Steps** (if not using sdlcctl):

1. **Determine your tier**: Based on team size and project complexity
2. **Update version headers**: Change "4.9" → "5.0" in all documents
3. **Restructure stage references**: Update all references to Contract-First order
   - Stage 03 is now INTEGRATION (was BUILD)
   - Stage 04 is now BUILD (was TEST)
   - Stage 05 is now TEST (was DEPLOY)
   - Stage 06 is now DEPLOY (was OPERATE)
   - Stage 07 is now OPERATE (was INTEGRATION)
4. **Apply tier-specific requirements**: Add only what's needed for your tier
5. **Create Team-Collaboration folder** (if STANDARD+)
6. **Update CHANGELOG**: Add 5.0.0 entry
7. **Validate**: Run sdlc_validator.py

**Migration Checklist**:
```markdown
□ 1. Update README.md version header to 5.0.0
□ 2. Update CLAUDE.md (if exists)
□ 3. Restructure stage numbering (INTEGRATE → Stage 03)

## 🎯 Version 4.4 - Adaptive Governance + Predictive Integrity (September 16, 2025)

**Release Date**: September 16, 2025
**Status**: ENHANCED – SUPERSEDED BY 4.4.1
**Type**: EVOLUTIONARY MAJOR (Adaptive Layer + Predictive Surfaces)
**Backward Compatibility**: 100% — All 23 SDLC 4.3 principles preserved (see Preservation Matrix)
**Breaking Changes**: None (noise reduction + integrity amplification only)
**Executive Certification**: CEO & CPO ACK (23:50 Sept 16 2025) — Backward Compatibility Integration Complete

### 🚀 Strategic Shift

From deterministic compliance (4.3) → continuous adaptive governance with predictive readiness, continuity integrity, and early drift anticipation. Governance now supplies proactive signals (continuity & coverage trajectories) before quality erosion, without loosening hard baselines (Design-First, Contract-First, English-only, Zero Tolerance).

### 🔐 Executive Mandate Alignment

Purpose (CEO): Maximize joint AI Codex + Human leverage under strict quality orchestration, enforce role accountability, design-before-code & test-before-merge invariants, guarantee enterprise coordination across local/remote & AI/Human compositions, and ensure shipped code executes successfully ("code that runs" principle). 4.4 operationalizes this via adaptive gates that reduce false-positive friction while keeping baselines immutable.

### 🧬 Preservation & Enhancement Capsule

- 23 legacy 4.3 excellence doctrines: RETAINED (no downgrades)
- Design-First cluster (2 / 14 / 23) → Unified "Design-First Integrity" composite
- Added continuity scoring scaffold (future enforcement)
- Introduced coverage grading taxonomy & readiness shadow mode
- Formalized future drift diff & anomaly forecast lanes
- Governance noise dampening planned (post continuity ≥0.85)

| Performance | Static SLO pass/fail | Trend + percentile delta envelope | Observability analyzer | Predictive degradation alerts |
| Tenant Isolation | Informal metric review | Graded coverage (EXCELLENT→CRITICAL) | shadow_readiness.py | Focused remediation path |
| Legacy Management | Indexed archival | Integrity + hash automation + continuity linkage | legacy_scan + hash_update | Faster trust validation |
| Pattern Library | Static repository | Planned reuse telemetry & anomaly detection | pattern_usage (future) | Drives reuse velocity |
| Automation First | Mandated ethos | Opportunity scoring (future) | automation_classifier (planned) | Higher ROI targeting |
| Complexity Mgmt | Manual architectural review | Complexity risk predictor (future) | complexity_risk (planned) | Earlier risk surfacing |
| Enforcement Noise | Rigid thresholds global | Adaptive context envelopes (region-aware) | adaptive threshold config | Fewer false positives |
| Executive Visibility | Aggregated periodic KPIs | Hash-chained leading indicators | KPI generator (planned) | Higher audit trust |

### 📜 Executive Acknowledgment Excerpt

“Backward compatibility integration complete; adaptive governance elevates signal precision without diluting any 4.3 excellence mandates. Proceed with continuity & drift specifications.” — CPO (23:50 Sept 16 2025)

### ✅ Summary Impact Statement

SDLC 4.4 delivers adaptive precision and predictive readiness while retaining every prior governance safeguard. Net effect: lower operational noise, faster integrity anomaly surfacing, sustained rigor.

### 🧩 Governance Specification Integration (4.4)

The continuity scoring engine (GOV-CONT-001) introduces dual weighting: Interim Implementation Weights (Freshness 0.45 / Coverage 0.25 / Evidence Integrity 0.20 / Drift Alignment 0.10) vs Target Weights (0.40 / 0.30 / 0.20 / 0.10) enabling gradual shift toward coverage emphasis once freshness stability (≥0.85 rolling) is achieved. Legacy Adaptive Model spec formalizes classification states (ACTIVE / SUPERSEDED / HISTORICAL / TRANSITIONAL) and standardizes the supersede banner now applied across principal 4.x artifacts. Case study cross-links justify strategic upgrade drivers and maintain executive traceability.

### 🏷 Legacy Governance Execution (Phase B Status)

Supersede banner Phase B rollout completed for: Core Principles, Implementation Guides, Deployment Frameworks, Training Frameworks, and Framework Controls (versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2). Remaining actions (Phase C) include: integrity ledger JSONL inception, drift specification (GOV-DRIFT-001), full lint normalization (MD022/MD032/MD031), and cross-link propagation into training overview modules.

### 🔗 Cross-Link References

- Continuity Scoring Spec: `specs/GOV-CONT-001-Continuity-Scoring.md`
- Legacy Adaptive Model Spec: `specs/GOV-LEGACY-ADAPTIVE-MODEL.md`
- Upgrade Case Study: `07-Case-Studies/CASE-STUDY-MTEP-BFLOW-4.3-LIMITATIONS-TO-4.4.md`

1. Integrity Ledger Placeholder (`LEGACY-INTEGRITY-LEDGER.jsonl` planned)
1. Lint normalization sweep across superseded legacy artifacts
1. Training overview cross-link injection (governance specs & case study)
1. Continuity engine shadow-run metrics integration into readiness composite

### ✅ Phase C Governance Completion (September 17, 2025)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Integrity Ledger Bootstrap | DONE | `99-Legacy/LEGACY-INTEGRITY-LEDGER.jsonl` seeded (placeholder hashes) |
| Drift Spec (GOV-DRIFT-001) | DONE | Skeleton authored (shadow mode) |
| Misfiled Deployment Reclassification | DONE | 4.3 file converted to pointer stub, ledger event recorded |
| Legacy Archive Cleanup | DONE | Removed empty dirs & backup files; updated normalization targets |
| Normalization Documentation | DONE | `tools/docs/README.md` enhanced with roadmap |
| Cross-Link Expansion | DONE | Training + upgrade docs reference continuity & drift specs |
| Traceability Register Alignment | DONE | Pending items collapsed or migrated to roadmap |
| CHANGELOG Augmentation | DONE | Added Phase C completion block |
| Reclassification Entry | DONE | Explicit pointer stub + ledger event documented |

#### Reclassification Entry (Explicit)

The legacy file `SDLC-4.3-Deployment-Framework.md` was found to contain full 4.4 adaptive deployment content. Action taken:

- Removed duplicated 4.4 operational content from legacy path
- Reduced file to minimal pointer stub referencing canonical 4.4 artifact
- Added governance cross-links (continuity, drift, legacy model specs)
- Marked exclusion from scanners & continuity/drift engines
- Appended reclassification event to integrity ledger (phase=PHASE_C_INTEGRITY_BOOTSTRAP)

Result: Eliminated duplicate authority risk; preserved historical breadcrumb for auditors.

Residual optional enhancements (deferred to tooling wave): ledger hash computation, drift scanner implementation, continuity snapshot script.
