## 🆕 What's New in SDLC 5.0.0 (December 5, 2025)

**SDLC 5.0.0 Stage Restructuring (Contract-First Order)**:

```yaml
LINEAR STAGES (Sequential per release):
  00-foundation:   WHY - Problem Definition
  01-planning:     WHAT - Requirements Analysis
  02-design:       HOW - Architecture Design
  03-integration:  API Design & System Integration ← Contract-First (BEFORE BUILD)
  04-build:        Development & Implementation
  05-test:         Quality Assurance
  06-deploy:       Release & Deployment
  07-operate:      Production & Operations

CONTINUOUS STAGES (Ongoing throughout project):
  08-collaborate:  Team Coordination & Communication
  09-govern:       Governance & Compliance
```

**Key Changes from Previous Versions**:
- **Stage Restructuring**: INTEGRATE moved from Stage 07 → Stage 03 (Contract-First principle)
- **Contract-First**: API Design (OpenAPI specs) must happen BEFORE coding begins
- **4-Tier Classification**: LITE (1-2) / STANDARD (3-10) / PROFESSIONAL (10-50) / ENTERPRISE (50+)
- **Governance & Compliance**: Quality Gates, Security Gates, Observability, Change Management

**Code File Naming Standards**:
- **Python**: `snake_case` (max 50 chars) - e.g., `user_service.py`
- **TypeScript**: `camelCase` (max 50 chars) - e.g., `arService.ts`
- **React**: `PascalCase` (max 50 chars) - e.g., `ARDashboard.tsx`

See Session 3 for details on code quality standards including file naming.

### Part 1: Why SDLC 5.0.0? (15 minutes)

**Slide 1: The Problem We're Solving**

```
Industry Reality (Standish Group, 2020):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ 70% of features rarely or never used
❌ 64% of features NOT essential (waste)
❌ 45% of features built are never used at all

Root Cause: Building solutions before understanding problems

Cost: $100M feature × 64% waste = $64M wasted
```

**Discussion Prompt**:
- "Can you think of a feature we built that users don't actually use?"
- "What would have prevented that waste?"

---

**Slide 2: SDLC Evolution (4.7 → 4.8 → 4.9 → 5.0.0)**

```

---

**Slide 3: What is Design Thinking?**

```
Traditional Approach (Build-First):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Developer assumption → Build → Ship → Users don't use it → Waste

Design Thinking Approach (Understand-First):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Empathize (Understand users) →
Define (Frame right problem) →
Ideate (Generate solutions) →
Prototype (Build minimum testable) →
Test (Validate with users) →
Ship validated solution

Result: 3-10x higher adoption, sustainable product-market fit
```

**Key Message**: Design Thinking ensures we build features users actually need and will use.

---

### Part 2: Design Thinking 5 Phases (30 minutes)

**Slide 4: Phase 1 - EMPATHIZE 🧠**

```
Purpose: Deeply understand users' pain, context, needs

Activities:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ User interviews (5-10 per persona)
✅ Journey mapping (visualize end-to-end experience)
✅ Empathy mapping (what they see, hear, think, feel)
✅ Observational research (watch in real context)

Deliverables:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 User personas (evidence-based)
📋 Pain points ranked by severity
📋 Journey maps with emotional journey
📋 50+ direct user quotes (evidence)

Time: 3-5 days
Template: Empathy-Map-Canvas-Template.md
```

**Real Example (NQH-Bot)**:
```
Problem discovered: "I don't trust the data anymore"
  → NOT "tracking is slow" (assumed problem)
  → ROOT CAUSE: Trust erosion, not efficiency

Insight: Emotional problem (anxiety), not functional problem (speed)

Impact: Complete solution pivot
  → Instead of "faster tracking"
  → Built "trust restoration through verification"

Result: 90% trust restoration (solved root cause)
```

---

**Slide 5: Phase 2 - DEFINE 🎯**

```
Purpose: Frame the RIGHT problem to solve

Activities:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Problem statement (evidence-based, specific)
✅ POV statement (user + need + insight)
✅ HMW questions (transform to opportunities)
✅ Success metrics (measurable outcomes)

Deliverables:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Problem statement (validated with 3+ users)
📋 POV statement (functional + emotional)
📋 20-50 HMW questions
📋 Success criteria (quantified)

Time: 2-3 days
Templates: Problem-Statement, POV-Statement, HMW-Questions
```

**Good vs Bad Problem Statements**:
```
❌ BAD: "Users need a mobile app for attendance"
  → This is a SOLUTION, not a problem

✅ GOOD: "Managers cannot trust attendance data due to
         5-10% manual errors, preventing data-driven decisions"
  → Describes actual problem, solution-neutral
```

---

**Slide 6: Phase 3 - IDEATE 💡**

```
Purpose: Generate diverse solution ideas

Activities:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Brainstorming (100+ ideas target)
✅ SCAMPER technique
✅ Analogies (borrow from other industries)
✅ Concept sketching

Deliverables:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 100+ raw ideas
📋 10-15 idea themes (clustered)
📋 Top 3 concepts (voted)
📋 Concept sketches

Time: 3-4 days
Template: Ideation-Brainstorming-Template.md

Rule: Defer judgment - no "that won't work" during generation
```

**Why 100+ Ideas?**:
```
First 20 ideas: Obvious, incremental
Ideas 21-50: Getting interesting
Ideas 51-100: Breakthrough possibilities

Real example (NQH-Bot):
  154 ideas → Top concept: GPS + photo auto-verification
  Eliminated: Biometric kiosks ($50K hardware cost)
  Saved: $50K by exploring alternatives
```

---

**Slide 7: Phase 4 - PROTOTYPE 🛠️**

```
Purpose: Build minimum testable version to learn

Fidelity Levels:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Paper (4 hours) → Digital mockup (1-3 days) → Code (1-2 weeks)

Always start at LOWEST fidelity!

Deliverables:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Paper prototype (8 screens, hand-drawn)
📋 Digital mockup (Figma, clickable)
📋 Code prototype (working, not production-ready)
📋 Known limitations document

Time: 5-7 days
Template: Prototype-Test-Plan-Template.md

Goal: Build minimum to LEARN, not minimum to SHIP
```

**Real Example**:
```
NQH-Bot Progression:
  → Paper prototype (4 hours): Found navigation issues
  → Digital mockup (3 days): Validated flow
  → Code prototype (2 days): Tested with real users

Total: 1 week vs building full solution (4-6 weeks)
Savings: 3-5 weeks by testing assumptions early
```

---

**Slide 8: Phase 5 - TEST 🧪**

```
Purpose: Validate with real users, decide ship/iterate/pivot

Activities:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ User testing (5-8 participants)
✅ Task completion measurement
✅ Qualitative feedback
✅ Assumption validation

Deliverables:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Test results (quantitative metrics)
📋 User feedback patterns
📋 Assumption validation report
📋 Decision: Ship / Iterate / Pivot

Time: 5-7 days
Templates: User-Testing-Script, Feedback-Analysis

Decision Criteria:
  ✅ SHIP: >80% task completion, validated assumptions
  🔄 ITERATE: 50-80% completion, fixable issues
  ❌ PIVOT: <50% completion, false assumptions
```

---

### Part 3: SDLC 5.0.0 Integration (15 minutes)

**Slide 9: Design Thinking + 10-Stage Framework (Contract-First Order)**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Design Thinking    SDLC Stage               Deliverable        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  EMPATHIZE 🧠    →  Stage 00 (foundation)   →  User Persona     │
│  DEFINE 🎯       →  Stage 00-01 (planning)  →  Problem Stmt     │
│  IDEATE 💡       →  Stage 01-02 (design)    →  100+ Ideas       │
│                  →  Stage 03 (integration)  →  API Contracts    │
│  PROTOTYPE 🛠️    →  Stage 04 (build)        →  Working Proto    │
│  TEST 🧪         →  Stage 05 (test)         →  User Feedback    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SDLC 5.0.0 Contract-First Principle:
  Stage 03 (integration): API Design happens BEFORE coding (Stage 04)
  This ensures system integration is planned early, not retrofitted

Integration = Seamless
  Design Thinking phases ARE part of stages (not separate)
```

---

**Slide 10: Quality Gates Enhanced**

```
Traditional SDLC:
  Gate 1: Design review
  Gate 2: Implementation review
  Gate 3: Production ready

SDLC 5.0.0 Quality Gates (Contract-First Enhanced):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Gate 0.1: Problem Definition (user-validated)
  Gate 0.2: Solution Diversity (100+ ideas)
  Gate 0.3: Prototype Fidelity (minimum to learn)
  Gate 0.4: Test Validity (right users, context)
  Gate 0.5: Ship Decision (validated assumptions)

  Gate 1: Design review (includes API contracts - Stage 03)
  Gate 2: Implementation review (Stage 04 build)
  Gate 3: Production ready (Stage 05-06)

Total: 8 quality gates (5 Design Thinking + 3 Implementation)
```

---

### Part 4: Discussion & Q&A (30 minutes)

**Discussion Questions**:

1. **"Can you think of a recent project where Design Thinking would have helped?"**
   - What assumptions did we make?
   - Did we validate with users first?
   - What was the outcome?

2. **"What concerns do you have about adding Design Thinking to our process?"**
   - Time investment?
   - Learning curve?
   - Client expectations?

3. **"How will this change our daily work?"**
   - More user research upfront
   - More prototyping, less full builds
   - More iteration based on feedback

**Key Messages to Reinforce**:
- Design Thinking SAVES time (4-6 weeks vs 12-24 weeks)
- AI accelerates 70% of DT work (synthesis, generation)
- We already have templates (no starting from scratch)

## 📚 SESSION 2: Design Thinking Hands-On Workshop

**Duration**: 3 hours
**Format**: Workshop with real exercise
**Facilitator**: CPO (Design Thinking expert)
**Group Size**: 5-8 people per group

---

### Workshop Structure

**Part 1: Mini Project Brief (15 minutes)**

**Scenario**: Improve team's daily standup meetings

**Current Situation**:
- 15-minute daily standup (9:00 AM)
- 15 team members
- Attendance: 70% (5 people frequently miss)
- Engagement: Mixed (some actively participate, others silent)
- Perceived value: 6/10 average rating

**Your Challenge**:
Use Design Thinking to understand the real problem and propose solution.

---

### Part 2: EMPATHIZE Exercise (45 minutes)

**Activity**: Interview 3 colleagues about standup meetings

**Interview Guide** (10 minutes per person):
```
Opening:
  "Hi, I'm learning Design Thinking and would love your help.
   Can I ask you a few questions about our daily standup?"

Questions:
  1. Walk me through your typical standup experience
  2. What do you find most valuable about standup?
  3. What frustrates you about standup?
  4. Do you attend every standup? Why or why not?
  5. If you could change one thing, what would it be?

Closing:
  "Thank you! This really helps me understand different perspectives."
```

**Facilitator's Role**:
- Pair people up for interviews
- Monitor time (10 min per interview)
- Encourage "why?" follow-up questions

**Deliverable**: Interview notes (3 sets, ~15 minutes of notes total)

---

**Activity**: Create Empathy Map (30 minutes)

**Using Template**: Empathy-Map-Canvas-Template.md

**Instructions**:
1. Review your 3 interview notes
2. Fill out empathy map:
   - What do they SEE? (standup room, others' body language, time pressure)
   - What do they HEAR? (updates, blockers, "let's take this offline")
   - What do they THINK & FEEL? (anxious, bored, rushed, valued?)
   - What do they SAY & DO? (give updates, ask questions, multitask?)

3. Synthesize insights:
   - Top 3 pain points (ranked by frequency)
   - Top 3 needs (functional + emotional)

**Facilitator's Role**:
- Walk around, review empathy maps
- Ask clarifying questions
- Ensure evidence-based (not assumptions)

**Group Share** (15 minutes):
- Each group presents their empathy map (3 min)
- Identify common patterns across groups

**Expected Insight**: Problem likely NOT "standup is too long" - might be "standup feels like reporting to manager" or "I don't get value from others' updates"

---

### Part 3: DEFINE Exercise (30 minutes)

**Activity**: Write Problem Statement (15 minutes)

**Using Template**: Problem-Statement-Template.md

**Instructions**:
```
Fill in the formula:

[User] has a problem: [describe problem]
This matters because [impact/consequence]
Currently, they [what they do now]
But this approach [why it fails]

Example (from interviews):
  Team members have a problem: they feel standup is
  "reporting to manager" not "team sync"

  This matters because 70% attendance indicates low perceived value,
  and missed blockers delay project delivery

  Currently, they give status updates in round-robin format

  But this approach doesn't facilitate team collaboration or
  problem-solving, just information broadcast
```

**Facilitator's Role**:
- Review problem statements
- Challenge: "Is this evidence-based?" (from interviews)
- Challenge: "Is this a problem or a solution in disguise?"

---

**Activity**: Generate HMW Questions (15 minutes)

**Using Template**: HMW-Questions-Worksheet.md

**Instructions**:
```
From your problem statement, generate 10 HMW questions:

Strategy 1 (Amp up the good):
  HMW make standup more collaborative? (amplify what works)

Strategy 2 (Remove the bad):
  HMW eliminate "reporting to manager" feeling?

Strategy 3 (Explore opposite):
  HMW make standup optional? (challenge assumption)

Strategy 4 (Question assumption):
  HMW sync without a meeting? (maybe standup isn't needed)

Strategy 5 (Identify resources):
  HMW leverage Slack for async updates?

[Generate 10 total HMWs]
```

**Group Share** (10 minutes):
- Each group shares top 3 HMWs
- Vote on most interesting HMW across all groups

---

### Part 4: IDEATE Exercise (45 minutes)

**Activity**: Brainstorm Solutions (30 minutes)

**Selected HMW** (from group vote): [Example] "How might we make standup collaborative instead of status broadcast?"

**Brainstorming Rules**:
```
✅ Defer judgment (no "that won't work")
✅ Go for quantity (50+ ideas target)
✅ Encourage wild ideas
✅ Build on others ("yes, and...")
```

**Process**:
1. **Silent brainstorming** (10 min)
   - Everyone writes ideas on sticky notes
   - One idea per note
   - Target: 10 ideas per person

2. **Share & cluster** (10 min)
   - Each person reads ideas aloud
   - Stick on wall
   - Group similar ideas into themes

3. **Build & combine** (10 min)
   - Pick most interesting themes
   - "Yes, and..." - build on promising ideas
   - Create 3-5 hybrid concepts

**Facilitator's Role**:
- Enforce "defer judgment" rule
- Encourage wild ideas ("what if standup was 5 minutes?")
- Help cluster ideas into themes

**Expected Output**: 50+ ideas clustered into 5-7 themes

---

**Activity**: Concept Selection (15 minutes)

**Dot Voting**:
- Each person gets 3 votes
- Vote for concepts that are:
  - Highest impact on problem
  - Most exciting/innovative
  - Feasible to prototype

**Result**: Top 1 concept selected

**Example Concept**:
```
"Async Standup + Weekly Sync"

Description:
  - Daily: Slack thread (3 questions, <5 min per person)
  - Weekly: 30-min collaborative problem-solving (blockers only)
  - Manager gets daily updates async
  - Team gets focused sync time weekly

Benefits:
  - Eliminates "reporting" feeling (async to manager)
  - Focuses sync time on collaboration
  - Respects different schedules (async flexibility)
```

---

### Part 5: PROTOTYPE Exercise (30 minutes)

**Activity**: Paper Prototype (30 minutes)

**Instructions**:
```
Create paper prototype of selected concept:

Materials: Paper, markers, scissors

For "Async Standup + Weekly Sync":
  Screen 1: Slack standup thread template
  Screen 2: Standup bot questions (3 questions)
  Screen 3: Weekly meeting calendar invite
  Screen 4: Blocker tracking board

Time: 20 minutes to create

Test: 10 minutes - walk through with another group
```

**Facilitator's Role**:
- Provide materials
- Encourage low-fidelity (rough sketches OK)
- Time management

**Deliverable**: Paper prototype that can be "played" (facilitator moves cards, user points and explains)

---

### Part 6: Workshop Debrief (15 minutes)

**Reflection Questions**:
1. What surprised you during this exercise?
2. How was this different from our usual approach?
3. What value did each phase add?
4. What would you do differently next time?

**Key Learnings**:
```
✅ User interviews reveal unexpected insights
   (Problem often NOT what we assumed)

✅ Quantity ideation unlocks breakthrough ideas
   (First 20 ideas = obvious, ideas 50+ = interesting)

✅ Paper prototypes save massive time
   (20 min prototype vs 2 weeks code)

✅ Design Thinking is systematic, not random
   (Templates provide structure)
```

**Next Steps**:
- Apply to real project (Session 4)
- Use templates on own
- Ask CPO for guidance when stuck

---

## 📚 SESSION 3: Templates, Code Quality & Code Review Excellence

---

### Part 3: Code Review Excellence (45 minutes)

**Subscription-Powered Methodology** (MTS/NQH Tier 2):

**3-Layer System**:
```
Layer 1: PRE-COMMIT (Cursor + Local AI)
  → Catch 70-80% issues BEFORE commit

Layer 2: PR REVIEW (Claude Max + Copilot)
  → Human-AI collaborative review

Layer 3: POST-MERGE LEARNING
  → Extract patterns, prevent recurrence
```

**Live Demo** (30 minutes):

**Demo 1: Pre-Commit with Cursor** (10 min)
```
1. Write code with intentional SDLC violation
   (e.g., Vietnamese comment in code)

2. Show Cursor real-time warning
   → Red underline, suggests fix

3. Run pre-commit hook
   → Commit BLOCKED

4. Fix violation
   → Commit successful

Key Message: "Catch at commit = 10x cheaper than PR-level fix"
```

**Demo 2: PR Review with Claude Max** (15 min)
```
1. Create PR with 3 intentional issues:
   - SQL injection vulnerability
   - N+1 query problem
   - Missing test coverage

2. Copy PR diff to Claude Max
   → Use PR Review Template

3. Show Claude output:
   → 3 issues found with specific line numbers
   → Severity ranking (Critical/High/Medium)
   → Suggested fixes

4. Post Claude review as PR comment
   → Request changes from author

Time: 5 min (vs 45 min manual review)
Savings: 40 min per PR × 80 PRs/month = 53 hours/month
```

**Demo 3: Post-Merge Learning** (5 min)
```
1. Show monthly pattern analysis:
   → "Vietnamese date format errors: 32% of PRs"

2. Show preventive action taken:
   → Added to .cursorrules
   → Created utility function
   → Team training scheduled

3. Show reduction:
   → Next month: 12% (down from 32%)

Key Message: "Learn from mistakes, prevent recurrence"
```

**Practice Exercise** (20 minutes):
- Pair up
- One person writes code with 2-3 issues
- Other person reviews using Claude Max
- Switch roles

**ROI Calculation** (10 minutes):
```
MTS/NQH Reality (15 developers):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Monthly Cost: $750
  Cursor Pro: $20 × 15 = $300
  Copilot: $10 × 15 = $150
  Claude Max: $20 × 15 = $300

Monthly Value: $16,000
  Pre-commit: 100 hours saved = $10,000
  PR review: 40 hours saved = $4,000
  Post-merge learning: 20 hours saved = $2,000

ROI: 2,033%
Payback: 13.5 days

Key Message: "Subscriptions already paid for - just optimize usage"
```
