### Hour 3: AI Tools Setup

**Install Core Tools** (30 min):
```bash
# 1. Claude Code or Claude Max
# Sign up at claude.ai

# 2. Cursor IDE (recommended for Tier 2 code review)
# Download from cursor.sh

# 3. Git & Pre-commit
git --version  # Should be 2.0+
pip install pre-commit

# 4. Optional: GitHub Copilot ($10/month)
# Install from VS Code/Cursor marketplace
```

**Configure for SDLC 4.9** (30 min):
```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init

# Setup AI tools (recommended - 96% time savings)
mkdir -p .sdlc

# Option 1: Use AI tools (PRIMARY - 1 hour per feature)
# See: ../06-Templates-Tools/1-AI-Tools/design-thinking/
# Copy AI prompts for 5-phase methodology

# Option 2: Manual templates (BACKUP - 26 hours per feature)
# See: ../06-Templates-Tools/3-Manual-Templates/design-thinking/
# Copy 9 Stanford d.school templates if AI unavailable

# Setup pre-commit hooks (Tier 1 code review base)

### Hour 4-5: Design Thinking First Feature (2 hours)

**Phase 1: EMPATHIZE** (30 min)
```yaml
Task: Interview 3 users about their pain points

Questions to Ask:
  1. What's your biggest challenge with [problem domain]?
  2. How do you currently solve this?
  3. What frustrates you most about current solution?
  4. What would ideal solution look like?
  5. How much time/money does this problem cost you?

Output: Fill Empathy-Map-Canvas-Template.md
```

**Phase 2: DEFINE** (15 min)
```yaml
Task: Frame the RIGHT problem

Template: Problem-Statement-Template.md

Formula:
  [User] has a problem with [doing X]
  because [root cause],
  which impacts them by [consequence].
  Currently they try [current solution]
  but it fails because [why it fails].

Example:
  Restaurant managers have a problem with daily reporting
  because staff don't fill forms,
  which impacts them by losing ₫2M/month revenue tracking.
  Currently they use paper forms
  but it fails because staff don't trust data usage.

Validation: Does this describe user's REAL pain? (Yes/No)
```

**Phase 3: IDEATE** (30 min)
```yaml
Task: Generate 10+ solution ideas

Brainstorm (20 min):
  - Set timer for 20 minutes
  - Write down EVERY idea (no filtering)
  - Aim for quantity (10+ ideas minimum)
  - Include wild/crazy ideas

Select Top 3 (10 min):
  - Which solve problem best?
  - Which are feasible to prototype?
  - Which excite users most?

Output: Top 3 solution concepts
```

**Phase 4: PROTOTYPE** (30 min)
```yaml
Task: Build simplest testable version

Options:
  - Paper sketches (5 min) - Test flow/concept
  - Figma mockup (15 min) - Test UI/UX
  - Code prototype (30 min) - Test interaction

Choose: Lowest fidelity that validates hypothesis

Output: Testable prototype ready for users
```

**Phase 5: TEST** (15 min)
```yaml
Task: Validate with 2-3 users

Process:
  1. Show prototype (don't explain)
  2. Ask: "What do you think this does?"
  3. Let them try (observe, don't help)
  4. Ask: "Would you use this? Why/why not?"
  5. Record feedback

Decision:
  ✅ >70% positive feedback → BUILD IT
  ⚠️ Mixed feedback → ITERATE prototype
  ❌ <30% positive feedback → PIVOT to different idea

Output: Ship/Iterate/Pivot decision
```

**Hour 5 Result**: Validated feature concept in 2 hours (vs 3-6 months traditional)!
