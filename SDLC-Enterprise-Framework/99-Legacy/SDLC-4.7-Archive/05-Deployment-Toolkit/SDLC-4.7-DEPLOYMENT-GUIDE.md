    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Mock Detection
        run: |
          python scripts/compliance/mock_detection_agent_v3.py

## 📊 Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Containerized Deployment
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Zero Mock Policy enforced
ENV NO_MOCK_ALLOWED=true

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Install with real dependencies only
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

### Pattern 2: Kubernetes Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:4.7.0
        env:
        - name: ZERO_MOCK_POLICY
          value: "enforced"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

### Pattern 3: Serverless Deployment
```python
# serverless.yml
service: myapp

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.9
  environment:
    ZERO_MOCK_POLICY: enforced

functions:
  api:
    handler: handler.main
    events:
      - http:
          path: /{proxy+}
          method: ANY

plugins:
  - serverless-python-requirements

custom:
  pythonRequirements:
    dockerizePip: true
```

## 🚨 Crisis-Ready Deployment

### Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to green environment
kubectl apply -f green-deployment.yml

# Test green environment
python scripts/validate_deployment.py --env green

# Switch traffic to green
kubectl apply -f green-service.yml

# Keep blue as backup
kubectl scale deployment blue-deployment --replicas=1
```

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Immediate rollback if issues
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app-deployment

# Or switch back to blue
kubectl apply -f blue-service.yml

# Investigate issues
kubectl logs -f deployment/green-deployment
```

### Crisis Response Deployment
```yaml
Emergency Deployment Process:
  1. Assess Impact (15 min)
     - Check error rates
     - Identify affected users
     - Measure business impact

  2. Quick Fix (30 min)
     - Deploy hotfix
     - Minimal testing
     - Monitor closely

  3. Permanent Fix (2 hours)
     - Full solution
     - Complete testing
     - Documentation

  4. Post-Mortem (Next day)
     - Root cause analysis
     - Pattern documentation
     - Framework update
```

## 📈 Performance Targets

### Response Time Goals
```yaml
API Endpoints: <100ms (p95)
Page Load: <2s (mobile 4G)
Database Queries: <50ms
Cache Hit Rate: >85%
```

### Scalability Targets
```yaml
Concurrent Users: 10,000+
Requests/Second: 1,000+
Database Connections: Pooled
Auto-scaling: Enabled
```

### Monitoring Setup
```python
# monitoring.py
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

request_count = Counter('app_requests_total',
                       'Total requests')
request_duration = Histogram('app_request_duration_seconds',
                            'Request duration')
active_users = Gauge('app_active_users',
                    'Active users')

# Use in your app
@request_duration.time()
def handle_request():
    request_count.inc()
    # Your logic here
```
