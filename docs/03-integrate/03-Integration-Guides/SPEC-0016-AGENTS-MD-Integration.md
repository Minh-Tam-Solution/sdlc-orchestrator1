# SPEC-0016: AGENTS.md Integration Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the **governance requirements** for integrating the industry-standard AGENTS.md format with dynamic runtime overlays to guide AI coding assistants while maintaining clean git history.

**Key Governance Principles**:
- Static AGENTS.md file committed to repository (stable, rarely updated)
- Dynamic overlay delivered at runtime (context-aware, frequently updated)
- SASE artifact migration path (deprecate MTS/BRS/LPS, keep CRP/MRP/VCR)
- Security validation to prevent sensitive information exposure

**Business Value**:
- Industry standard alignment (60K+ projects using AGENTS.md)
- Zero noise commits from dynamic context updates
- AI tool compatibility (works with all major AI coding assistants)
- Governance context without polluting repository history

> **Implementation Reference**: For technical implementation details (services, APIs, CLI commands), see SDLC-Orchestrator documentation.

## 1. Static AGENTS.md Structure

### Overview

The static AGENTS.md file provides foundational context that changes rarely and is committed to the repository root.

### Required Sections

| Section | Purpose | Content Type |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Quick Start** | Setup commands for developers | Environment setup, dependencies |
| **Architecture** | System overview for AI context | Layer diagram, key patterns |
| **Conventions** | Coding standards | Naming, style, test patterns |
| **Security** | Security requirements | Authentication, authorization, boundaries |
| **Git Workflow** | Repository practices | Branch naming, commit format, PR rules |
| **DO NOT** | Forbidden patterns | Anti-patterns, security violations |

### File Constraints

| Constraint | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Location | Repository root | Industry standard, tool discovery |
| Maximum length | 150 lines | Brevity for AI token efficiency |
| Maximum size | 50KB | Prevent abuse, ensure fast parsing |
| Update frequency | Rarely | Only for architecture changes, new conventions |
| Format | Markdown only | No executable code blocks |

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Generator Service

**Description**: System generates AGENTS.md from project analysis.

**Requirement**:

```gherkin
GIVEN a project needs AI code governance
WHEN the generator service is invoked
THEN the system SHALL:
  - Analyze project configuration files (package manifests, docker configs)
  - Extract setup commands for "Quick Start" section
  - Summarize design documentation for "Architecture" section
  - Parse linting/editor configs for "Conventions" section
  - Load security baseline for "Security" section
  - Generate forbidden patterns for "DO NOT" section
  - Output file meeting length constraints
AND the system SHALL validate:
  - File length within limits (truncate with warning if exceeded)
  - No secrets in generated content (block if found)
  - No internal URLs (redact automatically)
```

---

### FR-002: Static File Management

**Description**: System manages committed AGENTS.md file.

**Requirement**:

```gherkin
GIVEN a project has generated AGENTS.md
WHEN the file is committed to the repository
THEN the system SHALL enforce:
  - Location: Repository root directory
  - Content: Markdown only (no executable code)
  - Validation: Secrets detection, size limits
  - Tracking: Last updated timestamp, update reason
AND the system SHALL validate commits:
  - Check file size within limits
  - Scan for secrets (block if detected)
  - Scan for internal URLs (warn developer)
  - Require signed commit (ENTERPRISE tier only)
```

---

### FR-003: Dynamic Overlay - Version Control Integration

**Description**: Dynamic context delivered through version control check mechanisms.

**Requirement**:

```gherkin
GIVEN a code change is submitted for review
WHEN governance checks run
THEN the system SHALL post dynamic overlay containing:
  - Current SDLC Stage + Gate Status
  - Sprint Context (goal, velocity, remaining capacity)
  - Active Constraints (strict mode, security review, risky files)
  - Incident Constraints (detected issues requiring fixes)

AND the overlay SHALL:
  - Update on every code change
  - Include Vibecoding Index score with routing recommendation
  - Link to relevant documentation
  - Show time since last gate pass
  - Auto-expire constraints after resolution
```

---

### FR-004: Dynamic Overlay - Code Review Comments

**Description**: Structured comments provide context during code review.

**Requirement**:

  - Save context locally (ignored by version control)
  - Support filtering by stage, sprint, or constraints
AND the context SHALL include:
  - Stage and sprint information
  - Gate status with pass/fail indicator
  - Vibecoding Index score
  - Active constraints with severity
  - Sprint velocity metrics
```

---

### FR-006: Dynamic Overlay - IDE Extension

**Description**: IDE extensions provide real-time governance context.

**Requirement**:

```gherkin
GIVEN a developer uses IDE with governance extension
WHEN developer opens a project
THEN the extension SHALL:
  - Fetch context from governance platform
  - Display context in sidebar panel
  - Inject context into AI chat (invisible to user)
  - Update context periodically (real-time)
  - Show notification on constraint changes
AND the extension SHALL:
  - Cache context locally (reduce API calls)
  - Work offline (show last known context)
  - Support multi-project workspaces
```

---

### FR-007: SASE Artifact Migration

**Description**: Migration path from legacy SASE artifacts to AGENTS.md.

**Requirement**:

```gherkin
GIVEN SASE artifacts (MTS/BRS/LPS) are deprecated
WHEN migrating projects to AGENTS.md
THEN the system SHALL:

Deprecation plan:
  - MentorScript (MTS) → AGENTS.md "Conventions" section

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Generator execution | <10s | File analysis and generation |
| VCS check posting | <5s | Real-time context delivery |
| Comment posting | <10s | Code review context |
| CLI context fetch | <2s | Local developer experience |
| IDE refresh | <3s | Real-time updates |
| Secrets detection | <1s | Per-file analysis |

### NFR-002: Security Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Secrets detection | Block commits with credentials |
| Size limits | Enforce maximum file size |

---

## 6. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Static + Dynamic Separation

**Rationale**: Avoid polluting git history with frequent context updates.

**Approach**:
- Static file committed once, updated rarely
- Dynamic overlay delivered at runtime through multiple channels
- Clean separation of stable vs volatile context

### Decision 2: Industry Standard Adoption

**Rationale**: 60K+ projects use AGENTS.md, native tool support.

**Approach**:
- Adopt AGENTS.md format as-is for static file
- Add dynamic overlay as differentiator
- Maintain compatibility with Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code

### Decision 3: SASE Artifact Deprecation

**Rationale**: Proprietary artifacts have zero industry adoption.

**Approach**:
- Deprecate MTS/BRS/LPS (migrate to AGENTS.md + issue templates)
- Keep CRP/MRP/VCR (governance artifacts with audit value)
- Provide migration tooling and hybrid mode support

### Decision 4: Multi-Channel Delivery

**Rationale**: Different tools consume context differently.

**Approach**:
- VCS checks for universal visibility
- Comments for code review context
- CLI for local development
- IDE extension for real-time integration

---

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Generator Produces Valid Output

```gherkin
GIVEN the generator service is invoked
WHEN analyzing a project
THEN output AGENTS.md with all 6 sections
AND file length within limits
AND no secrets in content
```

### AC-002: Dynamic Overlay Delivery

```gherkin
GIVEN a code change is submitted
WHEN governance checks complete
THEN dynamic overlay is posted
AND contains current stage, gate status, constraints
AND updates within defined latency targets
```

### AC-003: Security Validation

```gherkin
GIVEN AGENTS.md contains secrets
WHEN commit is attempted
THEN commit is blocked
AND developer receives remediation guidance
```

### AC-004: SASE Migration

```gherkin
GIVEN legacy SASE artifacts exist
WHEN migration is performed
THEN content is preserved in new format
AND old files are archived
AND hybrid mode functions correctly
```
