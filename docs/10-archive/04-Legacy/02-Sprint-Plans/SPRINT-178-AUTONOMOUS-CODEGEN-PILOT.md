# Sprint 178: "Autonomous Codegen Pilot" — Vietnamese SME Launch

**Sprint Duration**: April 14-25, 2026 (10 working days)
**Status**: PLANNED
**Phase**: Stage 04 (BUILD) → Stage 06 (DEPLOY) — Autonomous Codegen Pilot Launch
**Framework**: SDLC 6.0.6 (7-Pillar + AI Governance Principles)
**Priority**: P0 (Vietnamese SME Pilot Launch — 5 Founding Customers)
**Previous Sprint**: [Sprint 177 — Coding Agent Loop](SPRINT-177-CODING-AGENT-LOOP.md)
**ADR Reference**: [ADR-055 — Autonomous Codegen with 4-Gate Validation](../../02-design/ADR-055-Autonomous-Codegen-4-Gate-Validation.md)
**Framework Reference**: [11-AUTONOMOUS-CODEGEN-PATTERNS.md](../../../SDLC-Enterprise-Framework/03-AI-GOVERNANCE/11-AUTONOMOUS-CODEGEN-PATTERNS.md)

## Sprint Goal

Launch **Vietnamese SME Pilot** with 5 founding customers using the complete ADR-055 autonomous codegen workflow (Gates G1-G4), add **Gate G4 (Deployment)** for staging/production deployments, implement **production observability** (Grafana dashboards + alert rules), and close **Sprint 175 mobile responsive** deferral. This sprint transitions from development to production pilot.

---

## Sprint Context

**ADR-055 3-Sprint Arc — COMPLETION**:
```
Sprint 176: Initializer Agent + Gate G1        ✅ COMPLETE
            ↓ Spec parsing → feature_list.json
            
Sprint 177: Coding Agent Loop + Gates G2/G3    ✅ COMPLETE
            ↓ Iterative code generation
            ↓ Auto-correction loop (max 3 retries)
            
Sprint 178: Full E2E Pilot + Vietnamese SME    ← YOU ARE HERE
            → 5 founding customers
            → Production observability
            → Gate G4 (Deployment)
```

**Sprint 177 Deliverables** (dependencies):

**Pilot Target**:
- 5 Vietnamese SME founding customers
- <30 min onboarding (Vietnamese runbook from Sprint 176)
- First value delivery within 1 hour (generate + deploy first feature)
- Feedback loop for Sprint 179+ improvements
