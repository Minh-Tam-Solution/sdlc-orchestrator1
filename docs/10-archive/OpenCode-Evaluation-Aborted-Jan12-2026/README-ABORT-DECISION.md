# OpenCode Evaluation - ABORTED (Jan 12, 2026)

**Date**: January 12, 2026, 10:15pm
**Decision**: Abort OpenCode Level 0 evaluation
**Authority**: Strategic pivot - Focus on Track 1 SASE
**Status**: ❌ ABORTED after 4 hours of initial evaluation

---

## Decision Summary

**Abort OpenCode evaluation immediately and refocus on Track 1 SASE (Q1 2026 priority).**

---

## Timeline

| Time | Activity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Jan 12, 9:00am | ADR-026 created and approved | ✅ |
| Jan 12, 9:30pm | Repository cloned, critical discovery made | ✅ |
| Jan 12, 9:45pm | Critical discovery documented | ✅ |
| Jan 12, 10:15pm | **DECISION: ABORT evaluation** | ✅ |

**Total Time Invested**: 4 hours

---

## Reason for Abort

### Primary Reason: Strategic Misalignment

**OpenCode is NOT an integration target**:
- OpenCode is a CLI/TUI tool (competitor to Claude Code, Cursor)
- No HTTP API for integration (ADR-026 assumption was invalid)
- Integration would require $50K-$80K fork + custom API layer
- OpenCode competes with AI coders, doesn't complement SDLC Orchestrator

### Secondary Reason: Resource Prioritization

**Track 1 SASE is Q1 2026 P0**:
- SASE framework enhancement requires full team focus
- SDLC 5.1.0 artifacts delivery (Weeks 1-14, Dec 9 - Apr 11)
- OpenCode evaluation would distract from core deliverables
- $30K OpenCode budget better spent on Vibecode CLI (our differentiator)

---

## What We Learned

### Critical Discovery (4 hours)

After cloning OpenCode repository, we discovered:
- ✅ OpenCode is TypeScript/Bun CLI application
- ✅ Interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface) only
- ❌ No REST API endpoints exist
- ❌ No "Server Mode" for HTTP integration
- ❌ Cannot integrate via adapter pattern (as assumed in ADR-026)

### Integration Options Evaluated

| Option | Budget | Timeline | Feasibility |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **A: CLI Wrapper** | $10K-$15K | 2-3 weeks | ⚠️ Limited value |
| **B: Fork + Custom API** | $50K-$80K | 8-12 weeks | ⚠️ Too expensive |
| **C: Governance Only** | $0 | 0 weeks | ✅ Better strategy |
| **D: Abort** | $0 | - | ✅ **CHOSEN** |

### Strategic Insight

**Better Positioning**: SDLC Orchestrator governs ALL AI coders (including OpenCode) via 4-Gate pipeline, rather than integrating one specific CLI tool.

**Market Narrative**: "We govern industry-leading AI coders" > "We integrate with OpenCode"

## Impact on Roadmap

### Removed from Q1-Q3 2026 Roadmap

| Quarter | Item Removed | Budget Saved |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Q1 2026** | OpenCode Level 0 Observation | $0 (already free) |
| **Q2 2026** | OpenCode Level 1 Pilot | **$30,000** |
| **Q3 2026** | OpenCode Level 2 Production | **$20,000** |
| **H2 2026** | OpenCode Level 3 Optimization | **$40,000** |
| **Total** | - | **$90,000 saved** |

### Budget Reallocation

**$90K saved will be reallocated to**:
- Vibecode CLI enhancements (IR-based codegen for Vietnamese SME)
- Track 1 SASE framework artifacts
- EP-06 IR-Based Codegen Engine (Sprint 45-50)

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Validate Architecture Assumptions Early

**Problem**: Assumed OpenCode had HTTP API based on external analysis
**Solution**: Always clone and inspect repository BEFORE creating ADR

### 2. Prioritize Core Differentiators

**Problem**: OpenCode evaluation distracted from Track 1 SASE (Q1 2026 P0)
**Solution**: Focus on Vibecode CLI (our differentiator) over external tools

### 3. Strategic Positioning Matters

**Problem**: Integration with one CLI tool doesn't scale
**Solution**: Governance layer ABOVE all AI coders (better positioning)

## Next Steps (Post-Abort)

### Immediate (Jan 13, 2026)

- [x] ✅ Archive all OpenCode documents
- [x] ✅ Remove OpenCode from CURRENT-SPRINT.md
- [x] ✅ Remove OpenCode from Product-Roadmap.md
- [ ] ⏳ Update team: OpenCode evaluation aborted
- [ ] ⏳ Refocus on Track 1 SASE (Q1 2026 P0)

### Track 1 SASE Focus (Jan 13 - Apr 11, 2026)

**Priority**: SDLC 5.1.0 Framework Enhancement
- Week 1-4: SASE artifact templates
- Week 5-8: Documentation + playbooks
- Week 9-12: Validation + QA
- Week 13-14: Delivery + retrospective

**Budget**: Reallocate $90K OpenCode savings to SASE/Vibecode CLI

---

## Final Decision

**OpenCode Evaluation**: ❌ ABORTED after 4 hours
**Reason**: Strategic misalignment + resource prioritization
**Budget Impact**: $90K saved, reallocated to core priorities
**Team Focus**: Track 1 SASE (Q1 2026 P0)

**Decision Authority**: CTO (strategic pivot)
**Documented By**: PM/PO + Backend Lead
