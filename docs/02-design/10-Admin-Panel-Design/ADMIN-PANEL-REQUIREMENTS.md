## 2. User Stories

### Epic: E-ADMIN - Admin Panel Management

---

### US-ADMIN-01: View Admin Dashboard

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to view a dashboard with system metrics so that I can monitor platform health at a glance.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Admin Dashboard
  
  Scenario: View dashboard with key metrics
    Given I am logged in as Platform Admin
    When I navigate to /admin
    Then I should see:
      | Metric | Description |
      | Total Users | Count of all registered users |
      | Active Users | Users active in last 7 days |
      | Total Projects | Count of all projects |
      | Total Gates | Count of all gates |
      | System Status | Overall health indicator |
    And all metrics load within 500ms

  Scenario: Non-admin cannot access
    Given I am logged in as regular user
    When I navigate to /admin
    Then I should be redirected to /dashboard
    And I should see "Access Denied" message
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Metrics cached with 5-minute TTL
- Real-time system status from health endpoint

---

### US-ADMIN-02: List All Users

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to list all users with search and filter capabilities so that I can find and manage specific users.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: User Listing
  
  Scenario: View paginated user list
    Given I am on /admin/users
    Then I should see a table with columns:
      | Column | Sortable |
      | Name | Yes |
      | Email | Yes |
      | Role | Yes |
      | Status | Yes |
      | Created | Yes |
      | Last Login | Yes |
    And pagination shows 20 users per page

  Scenario: Search users by email
    Given I am on /admin/users
    When I enter "john" in search field
    Then I should see only users with "john" in name or email

  Scenario: Filter by status
    Given I am on /admin/users
    When I select "Inactive" from status filter
    Then I should see only inactive users

  Scenario: Filter by role
    Given I am on /admin/users
    When I select "Admin" from role filter
    Then I should see only admin users
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Server-side pagination and filtering
- Search debounced 300ms

---

### US-ADMIN-03: Activate/Deactivate User

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to activate or deactivate user accounts so that I can control platform access.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: User Activation/Deactivation
  
  Scenario: Deactivate active user
    Given user "john@example.com" is active
    When I click "Deactivate" button for this user
    Then I should see confirmation dialog
    When I confirm deactivation
    Then user status should change to "Inactive"
    And user should be logged out immediately
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Activate inactive user
    Given user "john@example.com" is inactive
    When I click "Activate" button for this user
    Then user status should change to "Active"
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Cannot deactivate self
    Given I am logged in as "admin@sdlc-orchestrator.io"
    When I try to deactivate my own account
    Then I should see error "Cannot deactivate your own account"
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Deactivation is soft-delete (is_active=false)
- Invalidate user's tokens on deactivation

---

### US-ADMIN-03B: Bulk Delete Selected Users (NEW - Sprint 40 Part 3)

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to delete multiple users at once so that I can efficiently manage large numbers of user accounts.

**Priority**: P1

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Bulk Delete Selected Users

  Scenario: Delete multiple selected users
    Given I am on /admin/users
    And I have selected 3 users via checkboxes
    When I click "Delete Selected" button
    Then I should see confirmation dialog showing:
      | Field | Value |
      | Title | Delete 3 Users |
      | Warning | This action will soft delete the selected users |
      | User List | List of emails to be deleted |
    When I confirm deletion
    Then all 3 users should be soft deleted (deleted_at set)
    And I should see success toast "3 users deleted successfully"
    And audit log should record each deletion
    And users should be removed from the list

  Scenario: Cannot bulk delete if self is selected
    Given I am logged in as "admin@sdlc-orchestrator.io"
    And I have selected my own account and 2 other users
    When I click "Delete Selected" button
    Then I should see error "Cannot delete your own account. Please deselect yourself."
    And deletion should be blocked

  Scenario: Cannot bulk delete last superuser
    Given there is only one superuser in selection
    And no other superusers exist outside selection
    When I click "Delete Selected" button
    Then I should see warning about last superuser
    And last superuser should be automatically deselected
    And remaining users can be deleted

  Scenario: Empty selection
    Given no users are selected
    Then "Delete Selected" button should be disabled
    Or not visible in bulk action bar

  Scenario: Cancel bulk delete
    Given I have selected 2 users
    When I click "Delete Selected" button
    And I click "Cancel" on confirmation dialog
    Then no users should be deleted
    And selection should remain intact

  Scenario: Show loading state during bulk delete
    Given I have selected 5 users
    When I confirm bulk deletion
    Then "Delete Selected" button should show "Deleting..." state
    And be disabled during operation
    And show progress if available
```

**Technical Notes**:
- API: DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/bulk with body: `{ user_ids: string[] }`
- Each deletion creates separate audit log entry
- Self-delete prevention at frontend AND backend
- Last superuser protection with automatic deselection
- Soft delete only (sets deleted_at, deleted_by)
- Toast shows count of successfully deleted users

**CTO Conditions (Dec 18, 2025)**:
1. **Batch Size Limit**: Maximum 50 users per request to prevent DOS
2. **Partial Success Handling**: Return detailed report with success/failed counts
3. **Rate Limiting**: 5 requests/minute per admin to prevent abuse

**UI Components**:
- Bulk Action Bar: Add "Delete Selected" button (red/destructive variant)
- Confirmation Dialog: Show list of users to be deleted (type "DELETE" to confirm)
- Progress indicator for large deletions
- Show partial success report if some deletions fail

### US-ADMIN-04: Manage Superuser Status

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to promote/demote superuser status so that I can manage admin access.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Superuser Management
  
  Scenario: Promote user to superuser
    Given user "john@example.com" is not superuser
    When I click "Make Admin" button
    Then I should see confirmation dialog with warning
    When I confirm promotion
    Then user should have is_superuser=true
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Demote superuser
    Given user "john@example.com" is superuser
    When I click "Remove Admin" button
    Then I should see confirmation dialog
    When I confirm demotion
    Then user should have is_superuser=false
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Cannot demote self
    Given I am the only superuser
    When I try to remove my own admin status
    Then I should see error "Cannot demote yourself"

  Scenario: Minimum one superuser
    Given there is only one superuser
    When I try to demote that superuser
    Then I should see error "At least one superuser required"
```

**Technical Notes**:
- System must always have at least 1 superuser
- Promotion requires confirmation with warning

### US-ADMIN-05: View Audit Logs

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to view audit logs of all admin actions so that I can track changes and ensure accountability.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Audit Logs
  
  Scenario: View audit log list
    Given I am on /admin/audit-logs
    Then I should see a table with columns:
      | Column | Description |
      | Timestamp | When action occurred |
      | Actor | Who performed action |
      | Action | What was done |
      | Target | What was affected |
      | Details | Additional info (JSON) |
    And logs are sorted by timestamp descending

  Scenario: Filter by date range
    Given I am on /admin/audit-logs
    When I select date range "Last 7 days"
    Then I should see only logs from last 7 days

  Scenario: Filter by action type
    Given I am on /admin/audit-logs
    When I select action "User Deactivated"
    Then I should see only deactivation logs

  Scenario: Search by actor
    Given I am on /admin/audit-logs
    When I search for "admin@"
    Then I should see only logs by that admin
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Audit logs are immutable (no delete)
- Retention: 90 days minimum
- Export to CSV available

---

### US-ADMIN-06: View System Health

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to view system health status so that I can identify and respond to issues.

**Priority**: P1

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: System Health
  
  Scenario: View service status
    Given I am on /admin/system
    Then I should see status for:
      | Service | Expected Status |
      | PostgreSQL | Healthy |
      | Redis | Healthy |
      | MinIO | Healthy |
      | OPA | Healthy |
      | Backend API | Healthy |
    And each service shows response time

  Scenario: View system metrics
    Given I am on /admin/system
    Then I should see:
      | Metric | Description |
      | CPU Usage | Server CPU % |
      | Memory Usage | Server RAM % |
      | Disk Usage | Storage % |
      | Active Connections | Current DB connections |

  Scenario: Alert on unhealthy service
    Given MinIO service is down
    When I view /admin/system
    Then MinIO should show "Unhealthy" status in red
    And I should see alert banner at top
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Health check every 30 seconds
- Integration with Prometheus/Grafana links

---

### US-ADMIN-07: Manage System Settings

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to manage system settings so that I can configure platform behavior.

**Priority**: P1

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: System Settings
  
  Scenario: View current settings
    Given I am on /admin/settings
    Then I should see settings grouped by category:
      | Category | Settings |
      | Security | Session timeout, Password policy |
      | Notifications | Email enabled, Webhook URL |
      | Limits | Max projects per user, Max file size |

  Scenario: Update setting
    Given I am on /admin/settings
    When I change "Session Timeout" from 30 to 60 minutes
    And I click "Save"
    Then setting should be updated
    And audit log should record this change

  Scenario: Reset to default
    Given I changed "Session Timeout" to 60 minutes
    When I click "Reset to Default"
    Then setting should revert to 30 minutes
```
