# ADR-041: Framework 6.0 Governance System Design

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: APPROVED
**Date**: January 28, 2026
**Author**: Backend Lead
**Approvers**: CEO, CTO, CPO
**Framework**: SDLC 5.3.0 → 6.0

---

## Context

### Problem Statement

The SDLC Orchestrator was assessed as "infrastructure without value" because:
1. Does NOT help CEO work faster than manual SDLC Framework usage
2. Does NOT help team work better
3. Has infrastructure but creates NO measurable VALUE

### Expert Review Findings (6 Fatal Gaps)

| Gap | Source | Severity |
|-----|--------|----------|
| GAP 1: Orchestrator ≠ Path of Least Resistance | Expert 1 (Product) | CRITICAL |
| GAP 2: Missing Governance Signals (CEO Intuition) | Expert 1 (Product) | CRITICAL |
| GAP 3: Stage Governance ≠ Daily Work | Expert 1 (Product) | CRITICAL |
| GAP 4: Context Authority Over-Engineered | Expert 2 (Technical) | MAJOR |
| GAP 5: Feedback Not Actionable | Expert 2 (Technical) | MAJOR |
| GAP 6: No Dogfooding | Expert 2 (Technical) | MAJOR |

### Critical Principle

```
"GOVERNANCE MUST BE THE FASTEST WAY"

If Orchestrator adds >5 min friction per PR → PRODUCT FAILS
If CEO time does NOT decrease → PRODUCT FAILS
If developers bypass governance → PRODUCT FAILS

Success = CEO works FASTER + Team works BETTER
```

## Decision

Implement a **Quality Assurance System** (Pillar 7 in SDLC 5.3.0) with 6 key components:

### Component 1: Auto-Generation Layer

**Purpose**: Reduce developer friction from 30 min → <5 min per PR

| Generator | Trigger | Output | Time Saved |
|-----------|---------|--------|------------|
| Intent Skeleton | task_created | Intent document | ~15 min |
| Ownership Suggestion | file_modified | @owner annotation | ~2 min |
| Context Attachment | pr_created | ADR/spec links | ~5 min |
| Attestation Template | ai_code_detected | Pre-filled form | ~8 min |

**Technical Design**:
```python
class AutoGenerationService:
    async def generate_intent_skeleton(self, task: Task) -> IntentDocument
    async def suggest_ownership(self, file_path: str, repo: Repository) -> OwnershipSuggestion
    async def auto_attach_context(self, pr: PullRequest) -> PRContextAttachment
    async def pre_fill_attestation(self, ai_session: AISession) -> AttestationForm
```

### Component 2: Governance Signals Engine (Vibecoding Index)

**Purpose**: Capture CEO's "code smell" intuition as non-blocking signals

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Architectural Smell | 0.25 | God class, feature envy, shotgun surgery |
| Abstraction Complexity | 0.15 | Inheritance depth, interface count |
| AI Dependency Ratio | 0.20 | AI lines / total lines |
| Change Surface Area | 0.20 | Files touched, modules affected |
| Drift Velocity | 0.20 | Pattern changes over 7 days |

**Vibecoding Index Routing**:
```yaml
Green (0-30): Auto-approve (CEO doesn't need to look)
Yellow (31-60): Queue for Tech Lead
Orange (61-80): Queue for CEO (should review)
Red (81-100): Block + CEO immediate attention
```

### Component 3: Stage-Aware PR Gating

**Purpose**: Prevent working ahead of design

| Stage | Allows | Blocks | Message |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| 00-Foundation | docs/00-*/** | src/** | "Complete foundation first" |
| 01-Planning | docs/01-*/** | src/** | "Finish requirements first" |
| 02-Design | docs/02-*/**, schema.prisma | backend/app/** | "Approve architecture first" |
| 04-Build | ** | - | All code allowed with compliance |
| 05-Test | tests/**, bug fixes | new features | "Code freeze in effect" |

### Component 4: Context Authority MVP

**Purpose**: Validate code has proper context linkage (metadata only, NOT semantic)

| Check | Rule | Failure Action |
|-------|------|----------------|
| ADR Linkage | Every module references an ADR | ERROR: Orphan code |
| Design Doc Reference | New features have spec file | ERROR: No design |
| AGENTS.md Freshness | Updated within 7 days | WARNING: Stale context |
| Module Annotation | Header matches directory | ERROR: Organization confusion |

### Component 5: Actionable Feedback Templates

**Purpose**: Every error message includes CLI commands to fix

```markdown
❌ GOVERNANCE FAILED: Missing Ownership Declaration

📍 What Failed:
File `backend/app/services/test.py` has no @owner annotation.

🔧 How To Fix:
1. Open the file
2. Add at the top: `# @owner: @backend-lead`
3. Commit: `git add backend/app/services/test.py`

⚡ Quick Fix Command:
$ sdlcctl add-ownership --file backend/app/services/test.py --owner @backend-lead
```

### Component 6: Kill Switch + Break Glass

**Purpose**: Emergency bypass and automatic rollback

**Kill Switch Criteria**:
```yaml
auto_trigger:
  rejection_rate: ">80%"
  latency_p95: ">500ms"
  false_positive_rate: ">20%"
  developer_complaints: ">5/day"
rollback_to: "WARNING"
```

**Break Glass** (Emergency Bypass):
- Authorization: Tech Lead → CTO → CEO
- Audit: All bypass attempts logged
- Auto-revert: 24 hours if not properly approved

---

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Warning Mode (Week 1)
- Enable governance on Orchestrator repo
- Log violations but don't block
- Establish baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Soft Enforcement (Week 2)
- Block critical violations (missing ownership, missing intent, index >80)
- Warn medium violations (stale context, index 61-80)
- Measure friction and adjust

### Phase 3: Full Enforcement (Week 3+)
- All violations block
- Auto-approve green PRs
- Measure CEO time saved

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **CEO Time Reduction**: 40h → 10h per sprint (75% savings)
2. **Developer Friction**: <5 min per PR (vs 30 min manual)
3. **Code Quality**: Measurable vibecoding index
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete governance history

### Negative

1. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn new workflow
2. **False Positives**: Initial tuning required
3. **Maintenance**: Signals need periodic calibration

### Mitigations

1. **Kill Switch**: Auto-rollback on high rejection rate
2. **Feedback Loop**: Continuous improvement from PR reviews
3. **CEO Calibration**: Monthly review of signal weights
