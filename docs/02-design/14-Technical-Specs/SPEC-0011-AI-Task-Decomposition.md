# SPEC-0011: AI Task Decomposition Service - CEO-Quality Task Generation

**Status**: APPROVED
**Date**: December 3, 2025
**Decision Makers**: CTO, CPO (joint review)
**Stage**: Stage 02 (HOW - Design & Architecture)
**Framework**: SDLC 6.0.5

## Overview

### Problem Statement

**Vietnamese Context**: CEO có thể phân tích user story và decompose thành tasks hiệu quả. PM/Tech Lead khác mất nhiều thời gian hơn và thường miss edge cases.

**English Translation**: CEO can analyze user stories and decompose them into tasks effectively. Other PMs/Tech Leads take much more time and often miss edge cases.

**Current State**:
- CEO: 10 phút decompose 1 user story → 8-12 tasks với acceptance criteria
- Average PM: 30-45 phút → 5-8 tasks, thiếu edge cases
- Junior Dev: 60+ phút → incomplete decomposition

**Goal**: AI service decompose user stories with CEO-level quality in <2 minutes.

### Solution Overview

AI Task Decomposition Service that:
1. Accepts user story + project context + SDLC stage
2. Enriches context with project profile, related tasks, team velocity
3. Uses multi-provider AI chain (Ollama qwen2.5:14b primary → Claude fallback)
4. Generates structured task list with estimates, dependencies, acceptance criteria
5. Validates completeness against checklist (happy path, error handling, tests, docs, security)
6. Enables human review workflow (approve/modify/reject)
7. Exports approved tasks to GitHub Issues

**Quality Target**: Match CEO's decomposition quality (measured by task completeness score)

**Description**:
The system SHALL implement a multi-provider fallback chain for AI task decomposition with automatic failover on timeout, quota exhaustion, or quality degradation.

**BDD Requirement**:

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Provider Fallback Chain

    GIVEN Ollama provider is healthy and responsive
    WHEN I decompose a user story
    THEN the system SHALL use Ollama provider
    AND the response SHALL indicate provider "ollama"
    AND no fallback providers SHALL be invoked

  Scenario: Primary provider timeout triggers fallback
    GIVEN Ollama provider times out after 60 seconds
    WHEN I decompose a user story
    THEN the system SHALL fallback to Claude provider
    AND the response SHALL indicate provider "claude"
    AND the session metadata SHALL log fallback reason "ollama_timeout"

  Scenario: Quota exhaustion triggers fallback
    GIVEN Claude provider has exhausted daily quota (1000/1000 requests)
    WHEN I decompose a user story using Claude
    THEN the system SHALL fallback to GPT-4o provider
    AND the response SHALL indicate provider "gpt-4o"
    AND the session metadata SHALL log fallback reason "claude_quota_exhausted"

  Scenario: Quality degradation triggers fallback
    GIVEN Ollama generates tasks with completeness score 0.65
    AND the minimum required score is 0.80 for STANDARD tier
    WHEN I validate the decomposition quality
    THEN the system SHALL retry with Claude provider
    AND the new decomposition SHALL achieve score >= 0.80
    AND the session SHALL record quality_retry = true

  Scenario: All providers fail escalates to rule-based
    GIVEN Ollama times out, Claude quota exhausted, GPT-4o unavailable
    WHEN I decompose a user story
    THEN the system SHALL use rule-based deterministic templates
    AND the response SHALL indicate provider "rule-based"
    AND the session SHALL record provider_fallback_count = 3
    AND a warning SHALL be logged for engineering review
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

| ID | Criteria | Test Method | Expected Result |
|----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| AC-001 | Fallback chain respects priority order | Integration test: Mock provider failures | Ollama → Claude → GPT-4o → Rule-based |
| AC-002 | Timeout triggers immediate fallback | Performance test: 60s timeout | Fallback initiated within 1s of timeout |
| AC-003 | Quota exhaustion detected and handled | Integration test: Mock 429 response | Next provider invoked, no user-facing error |
| AC-004 | Quality degradation retries with next provider | Quality test: Low score (0.65) | Retry with Claude, achieve >= 0.80 |
| AC-005 | Rule-based fallback never fails | Stress test: All AI providers down | Deterministic templates return valid tasks |

**Tier-Specific Requirements**:

| Tier | Fallback Chain | Max Retry Count | Rule-Based Fallback Allowed |
|------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **STANDARD** | Ollama → Claude | 2 | Yes |
| **PROFESSIONAL** | Ollama → Claude → GPT-4o | 3 | Yes (with warning) |

def test_completeness_score_calculation():
    tasks = [
        {"title": "Implement auth", "description": "..."},
        {"title": "Handle errors", "description": "..."},
        {"title": "Validate inputs", "description": "..."},
        {"title": "Write tests", "description": "..."},
        {"title": "Update docs", "description": "..."}
    ]
    score = calculate_completeness(tasks, user_story)
    assert score == 1.0  # All 5 components present

# Test multi-provider fallback
def test_provider_fallback_on_timeout():
    with mock.patch('ollama_api.complete', side_effect=TimeoutError):
        result = decompose_user_story(story, project_id)
        assert result['ai_provider'] == 'claude'
        assert result['fallback_count'] == 1
```

### Integration Tests (90%+ coverage target)

```python
# Test end-to-end decomposition workflow
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_e2e_decomposition_workflow(test_db, test_client):
    # 1. Create user story
    story = create_user_story(test_db, title="Add authentication")

    # 2. Decompose
    response = test_client.post(f"/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/decompose", json={"user_story": story})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    session_id = response.json()['session_id']

    # 3. Approve
    approval = test_client.post(f"/api/v1/decomposition/sessions/{session_id}/approve", json={...})
    assert approval.status_code == 200

    # 4. Export to GitHub
    export = test_client.get(f"/api/v1/decomposition/sessions/{session_id}/export")
    assert export.status_code == 200
    assert export.json()['exported_count'] == 8
```

### Load Tests (100K requests target)

```python
# Locust load test scenario
class TaskDecompositionUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def decompose_user_story(self):
        story = generate_random_story()
        self.client.post(f"/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/decompose", json={"user_story": story})

# Target: 1000 concurrent users, 95% requests <120s
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Prometheus Query | Alert Threshold |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Decomposition success rate | `rate(decomposition_success_total[5m])` | <95% for 10 minutes |
| Average completeness score | `avg(decomposition_completeness_score)` | <0.80 for STANDARD tier |
| Fallback provider usage | `rate(decomposition_fallback_total[5m])` | >30% (indicates primary provider issues) |
| GitHub export failure rate | `rate(github_export_failed_total[5m])` | >5% for 10 minutes |
| AI latency (p95) | `histogram_quantile(0.95, decomposition_latency_seconds_bucket)` | >120s for STANDARD tier |

### Grafana Dashboard Panels

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Schema (Sprint 26 Day 1-2)

```sql
-- Create tables
\i migrations/001_create_decomposed_tasks.sql
\i migrations/002_create_decomposition_sessions.sql

-- Add foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE decomposed_tasks ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_story_id FOREIGN KEY (user_story_id) REFERENCES user_stories(id);
ALTER TABLE decomposition_sessions ADD CONSTRAINT fk_project_id FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id);
```

### Phase 2: AI Service Implementation (Sprint 26 Day 3-4)

```python
# Implement TaskDecompositionService
# - Input parsing: Extract user story components
# - Context enrichment: Load project profile, components, velocity
# - AI decomposition: Multi-provider chain (Ollama → Claude → GPT-4o)
# - Validation: Completeness scoring, tier threshold checks
# - Storage: Save to decomposed_tasks and decomposition_sessions tables
```

### Phase 3: API Endpoints (Sprint 26 Day 5)

```python
# Implement REST API endpoints
# - POST /projects/{id}/decompose
# - GET /decomposition/sessions/{id}
# - POST /decomposition/sessions/{id}/approve
# - GET /decomposition/sessions/{id}/export
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Sprint 27)

```python
# Unit tests (95%+ coverage)
# Integration tests (E2E workflow)
# Load tests (100K requests simulation)
```

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **PM Productivity**: 30-45 min → 2 min decomposition time (93% time savings)
2. **Consistency**: Same quality regardless of PM experience (CEO-level output)
3. **Completeness**: AI checklist catches missing edge cases (90%+ score vs 70% manual)
4. **Learning**: System improves from human feedback (rejection rate decreases over time)
5. **Cost Optimization**: Ollama primary provider = $50/month vs $1000/month Claude-only

### Negative

1. **AI Dependency**: Risk if AI service unavailable (mitigated by multi-provider fallback)
2. **Over-reliance**: PMs may stop thinking critically (mitigated by mandatory review for ENTERPRISE tier)
3. **Context Limitations**: AI may miss domain-specific nuances (mitigated by context enrichment)

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| AI hallucination (suggests non-existent components) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Validate against known component list, human review |
| Estimate inaccuracy (AI estimates off by >50%) | MEDIUM | LOW | Calibrate with historical team velocity, confidence scores |
| Provider quota exhaustion (Claude 1000/day limit) | LOW | LOW | Multi-provider fallback, rule-based fallback |
| GitHub rate limit (5000 req/hour) | LOW | MEDIUM | Exponential backoff, batch exports |
