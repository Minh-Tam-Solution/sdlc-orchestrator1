# Sprint 115: Soft Enforcement Specification

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: January 28, 2026
**Status**: DRAFT - Awaiting CTO Approval
**Sprint**: 115 - Soft Enforcement Mode
**Dependencies**: Sprint 114 Metrics Pass (Go Decision)
**Framework**: SDLC 5.3.0 Quality Assurance System

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 115 enables SOFT enforcement mode where critical violations block PR merge while medium violations generate warnings. This document specifies the enforcement rules, error message templates, and developer experience for the first enforcement phase.

**Goal**: Block critical issues while maintaining developer productivity.

## 1. Enforcement Mode Definition

### 1.1 Mode Comparison

| Mode | Critical Violations | Medium Violations | Low Violations |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **OFF** | Allow | Allow | Allow |
| **WARNING** | Log only | Log only | Log only |
| **SOFT** | **BLOCK** | Warn | Allow |
| **FULL** | **BLOCK** | **BLOCK** | Warn |

## 3. Error Message Templates

### 3.1 Template System

```yaml
# backend/app/config/governance_messages.yaml

message_templates:
  version: "1.0.0"
  language: "en"

  # =========================================================================
  # BLOCK MESSAGE TEMPLATES (Critical Violations)
  # =========================================================================
  block:
    ownership_missing:
      title: "Missing Ownership Declaration"
      icon: "user-x"
      color: "red"
      summary: "File `{file_path}` has no @owner header"

      body: |
        ## What Failed
        The file `{file_path}` is missing an ownership declaration.
        Every file in the codebase MUST have an @owner header.

        ## Why This Matters
        - Unowned code = unmaintained code = technical debt
        - When bugs occur, we need to know who's responsible
        - Ownership enables accountability and faster issue resolution

        ## How to Fix

        ### Option 1: Auto-Generate (Recommended)
        ```bash
        sdlcctl add-ownership --file {file_path}
        ```

        ### Option 2: Manual
        Add this header to the top of `{file_path}`:
        ```python
        # @owner: @{suggested_owner}
        # @module: {suggested_module}
        # @created: {today}
        ```

          url: "https://docs.sdlc.dev/ownership"

    intent_missing:
      title: "Missing Intent Statement"
      icon: "file-question"
      color: "red"
      summary: "PR #{pr_number} has no linked intent document"

      body: |
        ## What Failed
        This PR is missing an intent statement.
        Task {task_id} does not have a documented intent.

        ## Why This Matters
        - Code without intent confuses future developers
        - Intent documents capture the "WHY" behind changes
        - This is required for compliance and audit trails

        ## How to Fix

        ### Option 1: Auto-Generate (Recommended)
        ```bash
        sdlcctl generate-intent --task {task_id} --pr {pr_number}
        ```
        This will create: `docs/intents/{task_id}-intent.md`

        ### Option 2: Manual
        Create `docs/intents/{task_id}-intent.md` with:
        - Why This Change?
        - What Problem Does It Solve?
        - Alternatives Considered

        Then link in PR description: `Intent: docs/intents/{task_id}-intent.md`

        ## Reference
        - [Intent Documentation Guide](https://docs.sdlc.dev/intent)

      actions:
        - label: "Generate Intent"
          command: "sdlcctl generate-intent --task {task_id} --pr {pr_number}"
          style: "primary"

    vibecoding_red:
      title: "Vibecoding Index Too High"
      icon: "alert-triangle"
      color: "red"
      summary: "Index: {vibecoding_index}/100 (threshold: 80)"

      body: |
        ## What Failed
        Your PR has a vibecoding index of **{vibecoding_index}**, which exceeds the threshold of 80.

        ## Top Contributing Signals

        | Signal | Score | Contribution |
        |--------|-------|--------------|
        | {signal_1_name} | {signal_1_score} | {signal_1_pct}% |
        | {signal_2_name} | {signal_2_score} | {signal_2_pct}% |
        | {signal_3_name} | {signal_3_score} | {signal_3_pct}% |

        ## Why This Matters
        - High vibecoding index indicates potential code quality issues
        - CEO review is required for all red zone PRs
        - This prevents "vibecoding" - unreviewed AI-generated code

        ## How to Fix

        ### 1. Reduce Change Surface Area
        - Break PR into smaller, focused changes
        - Submit incremental PRs instead of one large PR

        ### 2. Address Top Signal
        {signal_1_fix_suggestion}

        ### 3. Request CEO Override (If Necessary)
        ```bash
        sdlcctl request-override --pr {pr_number} --reason "..."
        ```

        - **High**: {high_count}

        ## Findings

        {findings_table}

        ## Why This Matters
        - Security vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches
        - Critical/high severity issues MUST be fixed before merge
        - This protects our users and our reputation

        ## How to Fix

        Run Semgrep locally to see detailed findings:
        ```bash
        semgrep --config auto {affected_files}

      body: |
        ## What Failed
        You're modifying files that are not allowed in the current project stage.

        **Current Stage**: {current_stage}
        **Blocked Files**:
        {blocked_files_list}

        ## Why This Matters
        - Working ahead of design leads to rework
        - Stage gates ensure proper process is followed
        - Complete previous stages before modifying these files

        ## How to Fix

        ### Option 1: Advance the Stage
        If you've completed the prerequisites:
        ```bash
        sdlcctl stage advance --project {project_id}
        ```

        ### Option 2: Request Exception
        For emergency hotfixes:
        ```bash
        sdlcctl request-exception --type stage_bypass --pr {pr_number}
        ```

        ### Option 3: Move Files
        If files are in the wrong location, move them to allowed directories.

      body: |
        ## What Failed
        This PR contains AI-generated code but no attestation form has been submitted.

        **AI-Generated Files**:
        {ai_files_list}

        **AI Dependency Ratio**: {ai_ratio}%

        ## Why This Matters
        - AI code must be reviewed and understood by humans
        - Attestation ensures accountability for AI-generated code
        - This is required for compliance and audit trails

        ## How to Fix

        ### Option 1: Auto-Generate (Recommended)
        ```bash
        sdlcctl generate-attestation --pr {pr_number}
        ```

        ### Option 2: Submit via UI
        1. Go to /governance/attestation
        2. Select PR #{pr_number}
        3. Complete the attestation form
        4. Confirm review time met (minimum: {min_review_time})

        ## What's Wrong
        The AGENTS.md file hasn't been updated in {days_old} days.

        ## Why This Matters
        - AI assistants use AGENTS.md for context
        - Stale context leads to incorrect suggestions
        - Regular updates improve AI assistance quality

        ## Recommendation
        Update AGENTS.md with recent changes:

        ## What's Wrong
        The module `{module}` doesn't reference any Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

        ## Why This Matters
        - ADRs document architectural decisions
        - Modules should reference relevant ADRs
        - This helps future developers understand the "why"

        ## Recommendation
        Link an existing ADR or create a new one:

      summary: "Coverage delta: {coverage_delta}%"

      body: |
        ## What's Wrong
        Test coverage decreased by {coverage_delta}% with this PR.

        **Before**: {coverage_before}%
        **After**: {coverage_after}%

        ## Recommendation
        Add tests for the new code to maintain coverage.

      body: |
        ## Notice
        {ai_ratio}% of this PR is AI-generated code.

        ## Why This Matters
        - High AI dependency requires careful human review
        - Ensure you understand all generated code

        ## Recommendation
        - Review AI-generated sections carefully
        - Add inline comments for complex logic
        - Consider refactoring if code is unclear
