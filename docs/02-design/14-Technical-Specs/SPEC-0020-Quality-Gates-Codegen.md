    AND code contains 3 files: models/user.py, services/user_service.py, tests/test_user.py

  Scenario: All gates pass - Code is production-ready
    GIVEN Gate 1 (Syntax) validates all files with ast.parse
    AND Gate 2 (Security) runs Semgrep with 0 critical/high issues
    AND Gate 3 (Architecture) validates layer dependencies (no violations)
    AND Gate 4 (Tests) executes pytest with 100% pass rate
    WHEN QualityGatePipeline.run(files, blueprint) is called
    THEN result.passed == True
    AND result.total_duration_ms < 3000
    AND result.vietnamese_summary == "✅ Tất cả các gate đều PASS. Code sẵn sàng sử dụng."
    AND all 4 gates return passed=True

  Scenario: Gate 1 fails - Syntax errors detected
    GIVEN models/user.py contains "def create_user(name:" (missing closing paren)
    WHEN Gate 1 (SyntaxValidator) validates the file
    THEN gate_result.passed == False
    AND issues[0].file == "models/user.py"
    AND issues[0].vietnamese_message == "Cú pháp không hợp lệ"
    AND pipeline stops at Gate 1 (Gates 2-4 not executed)

  Scenario: Gate 2 fails - Security vulnerability detected

    WHEN Gate 2 (SecurityValidator) runs Semgrep
    THEN gate_result.passed == False
    AND issues[0].rule_id == "sql-injection"
    AND issues[0].severity == "high"
    AND issues[0].vietnamese_message == "Lỗ hổng SQL Injection - Dữ liệu người dùng không được escape"
    AND issues[0].fix_suggestion contains "Use parameterized queries"

  Scenario: Gate 3 fails - Architecture violation detected
    GIVEN models/user.py imports "from app.services.auth_service import AuthService"
    WHEN Gate 3 (ArchitectureValidator) checks layer dependencies
    THEN gate_result.passed == False
    AND issues[0].rule == "layer-dependency"
    AND issues[0].vietnamese_message == "Tầng 'models' không nên import từ 'services'"

  Scenario: Gate 4 fails - Tests fail execution
    GIVEN tests/test_user.py has assertion "assert result == 5" but result == 4
    WHEN Gate 4 (TestValidator) runs pytest
    THEN gate_result.passed == False

**BDD Specification**:

```gherkin
Feature: Vietnamese Error Translation
  As a Vietnamese SME developer
  I want all validation errors in Vietnamese
  So that I can quickly understand and fix issues

  Scenario: Syntax error translation
    GIVEN Python code with "def foo(:" (invalid syntax)
    WHEN SyntaxValidator detects SyntaxError
    THEN error.message == "invalid syntax"
    AND error.vietnamese_message == "Cú pháp không hợp lệ"
    AND error.line and error.column are populated

  Scenario: Security vulnerability translation
    GIVEN code with "password = 'admin123'" (hardcoded secret)
    WHEN SecurityValidator detects hardcoded-secret rule
    THEN error.message == "Hardcoded secret detected"
    AND error.vietnamese_message == "Secret được hardcode - Nên dùng biến môi trường"
    AND error.fix_suggestion == "Use environment variables: os.getenv('PASSWORD')"

  Scenario: Architecture violation translation
    GIVEN models/ layer imports from services/ layer
    WHEN ArchitectureValidator detects layer-dependency violation
    THEN error.rule == "layer-dependency"
    AND error.vietnamese_message == "Tầng 'models' không nên import từ 'services'"
    AND error provides layer dependency diagram

  Scenario: Test failure translation
    GIVEN pytest assertion fails with "assert 5 == 4"
    WHEN TestValidator runs tests
    THEN error.test_name is populated
    AND error.error_message contains "AssertionError: assert 5 == 4"
    AND system provides Vietnamese context in UI
```

**Vietnamese Translation Categories**:

| name 'X' is not defined | Tên 'X' chưa được định nghĩa |

Security Issues:

| Rule ID | Vietnamese Translation |
|---------|------------------------|

| xss | Lỗ hổng XSS - Output không được sanitize |
| hardcoded-secret | Secret được hardcode - Nên dùng biến môi trường |
| insecure-random | Sử dụng random không an toàn - Dùng secrets module |
| path-traversal | Lỗ hổng Path Traversal - Đường dẫn file không được validate |
| command-injection | Lỗ hổng Command Injection - Input không được sanitize |
| eval-usage | Sử dụng eval() nguy hiểm - Tránh dùng eval() |
| shell-injection | Lỗ hổng Shell Injection - Dùng subprocess với shell=False |

Architecture Violations:

### FR-03: Ollama Cost Optimization

**Requirement Statement**: System SHALL optimize Ollama usage through prompt caching, context window management, and model selection to achieve <$50/month per project operational cost.

**BDD Specification**:

```gherkin
Feature: Ollama Cost Optimization
  As a platform operator
  I want to minimize Ollama inference costs
  So that we achieve <$50/month per project target

  Scenario: Prompt caching for repeated validations
    GIVEN user generates code from same IR blueprint twice
    WHEN OllamaOptimizer receives validation request
    THEN cache_key is computed from (model + prompt) hash
    AND cached response is returned if exists and <1 hour old
    AND no Ollama API call is made (0 tokens used)

  Scenario: Context window management
    GIVEN IR blueprint contains 10,000 tokens
    AND Ollama model has 4096 token context limit
    WHEN OllamaOptimizer.should_use_ollama(10000) is called
    THEN returns False (exceeds 80% of limit)
    AND system falls back to Claude with larger context

  Scenario: Optimized prompt templates
    GIVEN user requests Python FastAPI code generation
    WHEN OllamaOptimizer.optimize_prompt("generate", context) is called
    THEN prompt is concise Vietnamese template (no verbose English explanations)
    AND prompt includes only essential IR fields
    AND estimated tokens reduced by ~40% vs verbose prompt
```

**Ollama Optimization Requirements**:

|-------------|-------------|
| Token estimation | Vietnamese text: ~3 characters per token |
| Threshold | 80% of model context limit |
| Fallback trigger | Exceeds threshold → use Claude |
| Context limits | Ollama: 4096 tokens, Claude: 100K tokens |

Prompt Optimization:

| Prompt Type | Purpose | Token Reduction Target |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| generate | Code generation from IR | ~40% vs verbose |
| validate | Code validation | ~40% vs verbose |

Optimization Strategy:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Vietnamese prompts | Concise Vietnamese instructions |
| Essential fields only | Include only required IR fields |
| No explanations | Request code only, no comments |

| Step | Validation |
|------|------------|
| 1 | Validate original code (expect failure) |
| 2 | Verify fix_suggestion is populated |
| 3 | Apply auto-fix to code |
| 4 | Validate fixed code matches expected |
| 5 | Re-validate fixed code (expect pass) |

Success Criteria:

| Criteria | Expected Result |
|----------|-----------------|
| Initial validation | passed=False |
| Fix suggestion | Non-empty |
| Fixed content | Matches expected fix |
| Retry validation | passed=True |

> **Implementation Reference**: For auto-fix test implementations, see SDLC-Orchestrator test suite.

| Ollama context limit exceeded | Medium | High | Automatic fallback to Claude for large blueprints |
| Vietnamese translation inaccuracy | Medium | Low | Native speaker review + user feedback loop |
| Test execution timeout (Gate 4) | Low | Medium | 120s timeout + skip tests option |

**Pure Methodology Notes**:
- This specification defines WHAT quality gates require for generated code validation
- For HOW to implement (service classes, SQL schemas, API endpoints), see SDLC-Orchestrator documentation
- Gate definitions are governance standard; implementation approaches may vary
- Vietnamese translations define coverage requirements, not dictionary implementation
- Performance budgets are SLA targets; monitoring implementation is tool-specific
