# SPEC-0015: Governance Metrics & Dashboards Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the **governance requirements** for metrics collection, aggregation, and visualization of the quality governance system, enabling data-driven decision-making for threshold tuning, mode transitions, and continuous improvement.

**Key Governance Principles**:
- 12 metrics across 4 categories for comprehensive visibility
- Real-time and aggregated metrics for different use cases
- Role-based dashboards (CEO, CTO, Developer)
- Automated alerting for proactive intervention

**Business Value**:
- Data-driven governance mode transitions (not subjective)
- CEO time savings measurement and tracking
- Quality assurance effectiveness validation
- Developer friction monitoring and mitigation

> **Implementation Reference**: For technical implementation details (database schemas, pipeline architecture, dashboard configuration), see SDLC-Orchestrator documentation.

## 4. Health Status Calculation

### Definition

Overall governance health combines multiple metrics into a single status indicator.

### Status Levels

| Status | Description | Typical Conditions |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **GREEN** | Healthy | All metrics within targets |
| **YELLOW** | Warning | Some metrics approaching thresholds |
| **RED** | Critical | One or more metrics exceeding thresholds |

### Risk Score Calculation

```
Risk Score (0-100) based on:
- Rejection rate vs 25% threshold
- Latency vs 100ms threshold
- False positive rate vs 20% threshold
- Complaint rate vs 15% threshold

Each metric contributes proportionally to overall score
Any metric at >80% of threshold triggers elevated risk
```

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Event ingestion | <1s (p95) | High volume supported |
| Aggregation completion | <5 min per hour | After hour boundary |
| Snapshot update | Every 5 seconds | For live dashboards |
| Dashboard load | <2s (p95) | With caching |
| Alert notification | <30s | From condition to delivery |

### NFR-002: Security Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Authentication | Single sign-on integration |
| Authorization | Role-based dashboard access |
| Data sanitization | No sensitive data in payloads |
| Audit trail | All overrides logged immutably |
| Rate limiting | Prevent abuse of ingestion |

---

## 6. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Four Metrics Categories

**Rationale**: Comprehensive coverage without overwhelming stakeholders.

**Categories**:
- Developer Friction: Adoption enablement
- Quality Assurance: Effectiveness measurement
- Time Savings: ROI justification
- Governance Mode: Stability tracking

### Decision 2: Role-Based Dashboards

**Rationale**: Different stakeholders need different views.

**Approach**: Three dashboard tiers optimized for:
- Executives: High-level health and ROI
- Operations: Detailed metrics for tuning
- Developers: Personal performance and feedback

### Decision 3: Progressive Alerting

**Rationale**: Alert fatigue reduces effectiveness.

**Approach**: Severity-based routing with auto-resolution:
- P0: Immediate action required
- P1: Review within hours
- P2: Track for trends

### Decision 4: Dual Storage (Snapshot + Aggregate)

**Rationale**: Different access patterns require different optimizations.

**Approach**:
- Snapshots: Frequent updates, short retention, dashboard queries
- Aggregates: Hourly rollup, long retention, trend analysis
