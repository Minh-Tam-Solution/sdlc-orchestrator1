# SPEC-0017: Feedback Learning Service

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the **governance requirements** for closing the feedback loop from code review comments back to AI planning improvements, enabling continuous learning and quality enhancement.

**Key Governance Principles**:
- Extract learnings from code review feedback automatically
- Categorize feedback into actionable types for pattern recognition
- Generate decomposition hints to improve future AI-generated plans
- Maintain audit trail of learning provenance

**Business Value**:
- Reduce recurring review comments by capturing and applying patterns
- Improve AI plan quality through accumulated wisdom
- Enable pattern drift detection for early issue identification
- Preserve developer context across PR reviews

> **Implementation Reference**: For technical implementation details (service classes, database schemas, API endpoints), see SDLC-Orchestrator documentation.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Feedback Learning Service closes the learning cycle from code review feedback back to specification refinement. This enables continuous improvement of AI-generated plans based on real-world review outcomes.

**Key Insight**:
> "No learning from code review feedback" - Identified as critical gap in governance systems
>
> **Solution**: Close feedback loop from Code Review → AI Planning Improvement
> - Extract learnings from review comments
> - Categorize by type (pattern violation, missing requirement, edge case, etc.)
> - Update decomposition hints for future generations
> - Improve AI context files with accumulated wisdom

### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope**:
- PR learning extraction with AI-powered categorization
- Feedback categorization (10 standard categories)
- Decomposition hints generation from recurring patterns
- AI context file update suggestions (quarterly)
- Integration with planning services for hint injection
- Learning statistics and dashboards

**Out of Scope**:
- Human-in-the-loop hint approval (ENTERPRISE tier enhancement)
- Cross-project learning aggregation (deferred to Phase 2)
- Multi-platform webhook support (single platform in v1.0.0)

### 1.3 Business Value

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Recurring review comments | Many | -20% reduction | Developer productivity |
| AI plan quality | Static | Continuously improving | Reduced rework |
| Pattern drift detection | Manual | Automated | Early issue detection |
| Developer context | Lost between PRs | Preserved and applied | Knowledge retention |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Learning extraction (per PR) | <30s | Includes platform API + AI analysis |
| Hint aggregation (per project) | <60s | Monthly batch job |
| Context suggestion generation | <2min | Quarterly, AI-intensive |

| Categorization accuracy | >80% | AI vs human review |
| Hint relevance | >70% | Manual review sample |
| Pattern extraction | >75% | Meaningful, reusable patterns |

---

## 6. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Multi-Provider AI Fallback

**Rationale**: Ensure categorization always succeeds even if primary AI fails.

**Approach**:
- Primary provider: Fast, cost-effective
- Secondary provider: Reasoning fallback
- Tertiary: Rule-based classification (no AI)

### Decision 2: Monthly Aggregation Frequency

**Rationale**: Balance between freshness and signal quality.

**Approach**:
- Monthly aggregation for hints (enough data to identify patterns)
- Quarterly for context suggestions (needs larger sample)
- Configurable for ENTERPRISE (flexibility)

### Decision 3: Confidence Threshold by Tier

**Rationale**: Higher tiers can handle more speculative hints.

**Approach**:
- STANDARD: 0.5 threshold (conservative)
- PROFESSIONAL: 0.4 threshold (moderate)
- ENTERPRISE: 0.3 threshold (aggressive, with approval workflow)

### Decision 4: Hint Injection Limits

**Rationale**: Prevent prompt bloat while maintaining usefulness.

**Approach**:
- Maximum 20 hints per plan generation
- Prioritize by confidence score
- Filter by task relevance when possible

WHEN learning extraction is performed
THEN all actionable comments are extracted
AND trivial comments are filtered correctly
