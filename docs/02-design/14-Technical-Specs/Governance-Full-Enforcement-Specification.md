## 4. Customer Documentation

### 4.1 User Quick Start Guide

```markdown
# SDLC Governance Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to Framework 6.0 Governance

This guide helps you get started with the Quality Assurance System.

### Step 1: Understand Governance Modes

| Mode | What Happens | When Used |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| OFF | No checks | Disabled |
| WARNING | Violations logged, not blocked | Initial rollout |
| SOFT | Critical violations block | Gradual enforcement |
| FULL | All violations block | Production |

### Step 2: Create a Compliant PR

1. **Generate Intent**
   ```bash
   sdlcctl generate-intent --task TASK-123
   ```

2. **Add Ownership**
   ```bash
   sdlcctl add-ownership --file path/to/file.py
   ```

3. **Run Pre-Check**
   ```bash
   sdlcctl pre-check
   ```

4. **Submit PR**
   - Intent will be auto-attached
   - Ownership verified
   - Vibecoding index calculated

### Step 3: Handle Violations

If your PR is blocked:

1. Read the error message (includes fix instructions)
2. Run the suggested fix command
3. Push changes and re-submit

### Step 4: Request Override (If Needed)

For legitimate exceptions:
```bash
sdlcctl request-override --pr 123 --reason "Production hotfix P0"
```

CEO/CTO will review within 4 hours.

```bash
# List pending overrides
sdlcctl list-overrides --status pending

# Approve override
sdlcctl approve-override --id override-123 --notes "Approved for P0 hotfix"

# Reject override
sdlcctl reject-override --id override-123 --reason "Not a valid emergency"
```

### Monitoring Dashboard

Access the CEO Dashboard at `/app/ceo-dashboard`:

- **Time Saved Today**: Hours saved vs manual process
- **Pending Decisions**: Override requests awaiting approval
- **Vibecoding Index**: Team code quality trends

### Kill Switch

For emergencies:
```bash
# Immediate rollback to WARNING
sdlcctl kill-switch --reason "High block rate detected"
```

### Break Glass

For production emergencies when CTO unavailable:
```bash
# Emergency governance bypass (4-hour duration)
sdlcctl break-glass --incident-type P0 --reason "Database outage"
```
```

### 4.3 FAQ Document

```markdown
# Governance FAQ

## General Questions

### Q: Why was my PR blocked?
A: Check the governance check comment on your PR. It includes:
- What failed
- Why it matters
- How to fix (with commands)

### Q: How long does governance evaluation take?
A: Less than 10 seconds for most PRs. Complex PRs with many files may take up to 30 seconds.

### Q: Can I bypass governance for urgent fixes?
A: Yes, request an override with `sdlcctl request-override`. CEO/CTO will review within 4 hours. For P0 incidents, use break glass.

## Auto-Generation Questions

### Q: Can I edit auto-generated content?
A: Yes! Auto-generation is a starting point. Always review and modify as needed.

### Q: Why did auto-generation fail?
A: Possible reasons:
- LLM timeout (will fallback to template)
- Invalid task description
- Network issues

You can always write content manually.

### Q: Is ownership suggestion always correct?
A: No, it's a suggestion based on git history and patterns. Review and override if needed.

## Vibecoding Index Questions

### Q: What is vibecoding index?
A: A score (0-100) measuring code quality signals:
- Architectural smell
- AI dependency
- Change surface area
- And more

### Q: How do I lower my index?
A: Common strategies:
- Break large PRs into smaller ones
- Add tests for AI-generated code
- Review and understand AI code before committing
- Follow coding standards

### Q: Why is my green PR still queued for review?
A: Even green PRs may be sampled for quality assurance. This is normal.

## Override Questions

### Q: When should I request an override?
A: Only for legitimate emergencies:
- Production hotfixes (P0/P1)
- Security patches
- Regulatory deadlines

NOT for:
- Feature deadlines
- Convenience
- Time pressure

### Q: How long does override approval take?
A: SLA is 4 hours. For P0 incidents, use break glass for immediate bypass.
