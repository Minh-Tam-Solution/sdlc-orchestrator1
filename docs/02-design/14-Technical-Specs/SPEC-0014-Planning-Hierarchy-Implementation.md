# SPEC-0014: Planning Hierarchy Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the **governance requirements** for a 4-level planning hierarchy system that provides strategic-to-tactical traceability from vision statements down to individual backlog items.

**Key Governance Principles**:
- 4-level hierarchy: Roadmap → Phase → Sprint → Backlog
- Vision-to-task traceability with alignment scoring
- Tier-appropriate planning depth (LITE to ENTERPRISE)
- Evidence-based planning with audit trail

**Business Value**:
- Strategic alignment visibility (vision → daily tasks)
- Progress tracking across planning levels
- Compliance evidence for quality gates
- Resource allocation and velocity tracking

> **Implementation Reference**: For technical implementation details (database schemas, ORM models, API endpoints), see SDLC-Orchestrator documentation.

### 1.2 Traceability Chain

Every backlog item SHOULD be traceable up to the strategic vision:

```
Backlog Item → Sprint Goal → Phase Objective → Roadmap Vision
```

## 4. Status Lifecycles

### Roadmap Lifecycle
```
draft → active → archived
```
- **draft**: Initial creation, editing allowed
- **active**: Current strategic direction, approval required
- **archived**: Historical reference, read-only

### Phase Lifecycle
```
planned → active → completed
```
- **planned**: Future quarter, can modify
- **active**: Current work, limited changes
- **completed**: Retrospective available, read-only

### Sprint Lifecycle
```
planned → active → completed
```
- **planned**: Backlog refinement stage
- **active**: In-progress work
- **completed**: Done, retrospective required

### Backlog Item Lifecycle
```
backlog → todo → in_progress → review → done
```
- **backlog**: Unscheduled, needs refinement
- **todo**: Scheduled in sprint, ready to start
- **in_progress**: Active development
- **review**: Code review / QA
- **done**: Meets definition of done

---

## 5. Alignment Score Algorithm

### Purpose
Measure how well a backlog item aligns with strategic vision.

### Calculation

```
Score = (Keyword × 0.4) + (SprintGoal × 0.3) + (Criteria × 0.2) + (Gate × 0.1)

Where:
- Keyword: Item labels ∩ Phase objectives (0-1)
- SprintGoal: Item in sprint goal keywords (0-1)
- Criteria: Item has ≥3 acceptance criteria (0-1)
- Gate: Item contributes to phase target_gates (0-1)

Final: min(1.0, weighted sum)
```

### Interpretation

| Score Range | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 0.8 - 1.0 | Highly aligned | Excellent traceability |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | Well aligned | Good strategic fit |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | Moderately aligned | Review objectives |
| 0.2 - 0.4 | Weakly aligned | Consider re-linking |
| 0.0 - 0.2 | Not aligned | May be orphan work |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance Targets

| Operation | Target Latency (p95) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Hierarchy retrieval (100 items) | <200ms | Optimized queries |
| Traceability calculation (cached) | <100ms | With cache |
| External sync (50 items) | <5s | Rate limited |
| Export (markdown) | <1s | Async for large |

### NFR-002: Security Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Authentication | Token-based with expiry |
| Authorization | Role-based access (PM, Dev, QA) |
| Data validation | Input sanitization |
| Rate limiting | Sync operations limited |
| Audit trail | All updates logged |

---

## 7. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Four-Level Hierarchy

**Rationale**: Industry standard structure with clear separation of concerns.

**Levels**:
- Roadmap (1-3 years) → Executive-level vision
- Phase (3 months) → Quarterly objectives
- Sprint (1-2 weeks) → Iteration planning
- Backlog (daily) → Task execution

**Alternative Rejected**: 3-level (no Phase) - Teams need quarterly planning for enterprise projects.

### Decision 2: Flexible Data Storage

**Rationale**: Planning structures vary by team and evolve over time.

**Approach**: Use flexible storage for varying data (objectives, metrics) while maintaining typed fields for critical data (dates, status).

**Trade-offs**:
- Pro: Schema evolution without migrations
- Con: Application-level validation required

### Decision 3: Read-Only External Bridge

**Rationale**: SDLC Orchestrator governs, not replaces. External tools remain source of truth for issue tracking.

**Approach**: Read from external tools, never write back.

**Future**: Bi-directional sync deferred to ENTERPRISE tier.

### Decision 4: Weighted Alignment Score

**Rationale**: Multiple factors contribute to strategic alignment.

**Weights** (calibrated from pilot feedback):
- Keyword matching: 40% (primary indicator)
- Sprint goal alignment: 30% (tactical focus)
- Acceptance criteria: 20% (definition clarity)
- Gate contribution: 10% (quality milestone)

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Roadmap Creation

```gherkin
GIVEN a project exists
WHEN a product owner creates a roadmap with valid vision and timeframe
THEN the roadmap is persisted in draft status
AND only one active roadmap can exist per project
AND approval is required to activate
```

### AC-002: Phase Boundary Validation

```gherkin
GIVEN a roadmap with timeframe Jan 2026 - Dec 2026
WHEN a phase is created with dates outside this range
THEN the system rejects the phase with validation error
AND the error message indicates the boundary constraint
```

### AC-003: Traceability Chain

```gherkin
GIVEN a backlog item linked to sprint → phase → roadmap
WHEN traceability is requested
THEN the full chain is returned with alignment score
AND contributing factors breakdown is included
```

### AC-004: External Sync Idempotency

```gherkin
GIVEN an external item was previously synced
WHEN sync is triggered again
THEN the existing backlog item is updated (not duplicated)
AND sync statistics reflect update count
```

### AC-005: Tier-Appropriate Depth

```gherkin
GIVEN a STANDARD tier project
WHEN hierarchy is requested
THEN only Sprint and Backlog levels are returned
AND Roadmap and Phase are not included
```

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Planning overhead | Medium | Medium | Start with STANDARD tier (Sprint+Backlog only) |
| Stale alignment scores | Low | Medium | Auto-invalidate on hierarchy changes |
| External sync failures | Medium | Low | Partial sync + retry mechanism |
| Over-complicated hierarchy | Low | High | Tier-appropriate features |
