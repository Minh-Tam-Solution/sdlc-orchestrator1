# SPEC-0013: Teams Data Model Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the **governance requirements** for multi-tenant team management, introducing organizational hierarchy, team collaboration units, and AI agent membership aligned with SASE principles (Software Engineering for Humans & Agents).

**Key Governance Principles**:
- Multi-tenant isolation with clear billing and compliance boundaries
- Team-based collaboration units within organizations
- Role-based access control (owner, admin, member, ai_agent)
- SASE-compliant AI agent restrictions (Coaches vs Executors)
- Zero-downtime migration strategy

**Business Value**:
- Enables enterprise multi-tenancy with clear billing boundaries
- Supports hybrid human-AI teams per SDLC AI Governance Principles
- Provides VCR authority hierarchy (owner → admin → member → ai_agent)
- Facilitates team-scoped policy enforcement and evidence collection

> **Implementation Reference**: For technical implementation details (database schemas, ORM models, migrations), see SDLC-Orchestrator documentation.

**Requirement**:

```gherkin
GIVEN the system requires multi-tenant isolation
WHEN an organization is created
THEN the system SHALL:
  - Assign a globally unique identifier
  - Enforce globally unique URL-safe slug
  - Associate a plan tier (free, pro, enterprise)
  - Store configurable settings (policy pack, MFA requirement, allowed domains, limits, branding)
  - Track creation and update timestamps
AND the organization can contain multiple teams and users
AND plan values are validated against allowed options
```

**Entity Attributes** (Semantic):

| Attribute | Description | Constraints |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Identifier | Unique organization ID | Globally unique |
| Name | Display name | 1-255 characters, required |
| Slug | URL-safe identifier | Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, globally unique |

### FR-003: Team Membership - SASE-Compliant Roles

**Description**: Team membership supports hybrid human-AI team composition with role-based access control aligned with SASE principles.

**Requirement**:

```gherkin
GIVEN the system supports hybrid human-AI team composition
WHEN a user is added to a team with role and member type
THEN the system SHALL:
  - Assign a unique membership identifier

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Organization Entity

```gherkin
GIVEN the multi-tenant system is deployed
WHEN an organization is created with valid name, slug, and plan
THEN the organization is persisted with unique identifier
AND the slug is globally unique
AND the plan is validated against allowed values
AND timestamps are automatically managed
```

### AC-002: Team Entity

```gherkin
GIVEN an organization exists
WHEN a team is created with valid name and slug
THEN the team is persisted with unique identifier
AND the team is linked to the parent organization
AND the slug is unique within the organization scope
AND deleting the organization cascades to delete the team
```

### AC-003: SASE Constraint Enforcement

```gherkin
GIVEN the SASE principle "AI agents cannot be decision-makers"
WHEN an AI agent is added to a team with role 'owner' or 'admin'
THEN the system SHALL reject the request with clear error message
AND when an AI agent is added with role 'member' or 'ai_agent'
THEN the system SHALL accept the request
```

### AC-004: Membership Uniqueness

```gherkin
GIVEN a user is already a member of a team
WHEN the same user is added to the same team again
THEN the system SHALL reject the duplicate membership
```

### AC-005: Cascade Delete Behavior

```gherkin
GIVEN an organization with teams and team members
WHEN the organization is deleted
THEN all child teams are deleted
AND all team memberships are deleted
AND users are NOT deleted (remain orphaned from organization)
AND projects are NOT deleted (remain with orphaned team reference)
```

### AC-006: Migration Compatibility

```gherkin
GIVEN existing users and projects without organization/team associations
WHEN the multi-tenant feature is deployed
THEN existing users are assigned to a default organization
AND existing projects are assigned to a default team
AND zero downtime is achieved during migration
```

## 4. Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Flexible Settings over Fixed Schema

**Rationale**: Use flexible configuration objects for organization and team settings to allow schema evolution without breaking changes.

**Pros**:
- No schema changes required for new settings
- Supports tenant-specific configuration
- Queryable and indexable

**Cons**:
- Validation must be done in application layer
- No referential integrity for nested keys

### Decision 2: Slug Uniqueness Scoped to Organization

**Rationale**: Team slugs are unique per organization, not globally, allowing different orgs to use the same slug (e.g., "backend-team").

**Pros**:
- Natural naming for teams
- Cleaner URLs: `/orgs/{org-slug}/teams/{team-slug}`

**Cons**:
- Slug lookup requires organization context

### Decision 3: SASE-Compliant AI Agent Restrictions

**Rationale**: Enforce SASE principles at data layer: AI agents (SE4A Executors) cannot have owner/admin roles (SE4H Coaches).

**Pros**:
- Cannot be bypassed by application bugs
- Aligns with SDLC AI Governance Principles
- Prevents VCR authority delegation to AI agents

**Reference**: SDLC Framework Section "AI Governance Principles", Principle 2: "AI agents are executors, not decision-makers"

### Decision 4: Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy

**Rationale**: Use phased migration (nullable → data migration → required) for zero-downtime deployment.

**Pros**:
- Application continues running during migration
- Safe rollback capability

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data migration failure | MEDIUM | HIGH | Test with production-like dataset, maintain rollback plan |
| SASE constraint breaks workflows | LOW | MEDIUM | Audit existing AI agent usage before migration |
| Performance degradation | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Index all foreign keys, optimize relationship queries |
