## 2. User Stories

### Epic: E-ADMIN - Admin Panel Management

---

### US-ADMIN-01: View Admin Dashboard

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to view a dashboard with system metrics so that I can monitor platform health at a glance.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Admin Dashboard
  
  Scenario: View dashboard with key metrics
    Given I am logged in as Platform Admin
    When I navigate to /admin
    Then I should see:
      | Metric | Description |
      | Total Users | Count of all registered users |
      | Active Users | Users active in last 7 days |
      | Total Projects | Count of all projects |
      | Total Gates | Count of all gates |
      | System Status | Overall health indicator |
    And all metrics load within 500ms

  Scenario: Non-admin cannot access
    Given I am logged in as regular user
    When I navigate to /admin
    Then I should be redirected to /dashboard
    And I should see "Access Denied" message
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Metrics cached with 5-minute TTL
- Real-time system status from health endpoint

### US-ADMIN-02: List All Users

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to list all users with search and filter capabilities so that I can find and manage specific users.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: User Listing
  
  Scenario: View paginated user list
    Given I am on /admin/users
    Then I should see a table with columns:
      | Column | Sortable |
      | Name | Yes |
      | Email | Yes |
      | Role | Yes |
      | Status | Yes |
      | Created | Yes |
      | Last Login | Yes |
    And pagination shows 20 users per page

  Scenario: Search users by email
    Given I am on /admin/users
    When I enter "john" in search field
    Then I should see only users with "john" in name or email

  Scenario: Filter by status
    Given I am on /admin/users
    When I select "Inactive" from status filter
    Then I should see only inactive users

  Scenario: Filter by role
    Given I am on /admin/users
    When I select "Admin" from role filter
    Then I should see only admin users
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Server-side pagination and filtering
- Search debounced 300ms

### US-ADMIN-03: Activate/Deactivate User

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to activate or deactivate user accounts so that I can control platform access.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: User Activation/Deactivation
  
  Scenario: Deactivate active user
    Given user "john@example.com" is active
    When I click "Deactivate" button for this user
    Then I should see confirmation dialog
    When I confirm deactivation
    Then user status should change to "Inactive"
    And user should be logged out immediately
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Activate inactive user
    Given user "john@example.com" is inactive
    When I click "Activate" button for this user
    Then user status should change to "Active"
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Cannot deactivate self
    Given I am logged in as "admin@sdlc-orchestrator.io"
    When I try to deactivate my own account
    Then I should see error "Cannot deactivate your own account"
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Deactivation is soft-delete (is_active=false)
- Invalidate user's tokens on deactivation

### US-ADMIN-04: Manage Superuser Status

**Story**: As a Platform Admin, I want to promote/demote superuser status so that I can manage admin access.

**Priority**: P0

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Superuser Management
  
  Scenario: Promote user to superuser
    Given user "john@example.com" is not superuser
    When I click "Make Admin" button
    Then I should see confirmation dialog with warning
    When I confirm promotion
    Then user should have is_superuser=true
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Demote superuser
    Given user "john@example.com" is superuser
    When I click "Remove Admin" button
    Then I should see confirmation dialog
    When I confirm demotion
    Then user should have is_superuser=false
    And audit log should record this action

  Scenario: Cannot demote self
    Given I am the only superuser
    When I try to remove my own admin status
    Then I should see error "Cannot demote yourself"

  Scenario: Minimum one superuser
    Given there is only one superuser
    When I try to demote that superuser
    Then I should see error "At least one superuser required"
```

**Technical Notes**:
- System must always have at least 1 superuser
- Promotion requires confirmation with warning

  Scenario: Update setting
    Given I am on /admin/settings
    When I change "Session Timeout" from 30 to 60 minutes
    And I click "Save"
    Then setting should be updated
    And audit log should record this change

  Scenario: Reset to default
    Given I changed "Session Timeout" to 60 minutes
