## SDLC 4.9 Framework Overview

### What is SDLC 4.9?

SDLC 4.9 is the **Complete 10-Stage Lifecycle** methodology that ensures governance-first development with evidence-based quality gates.

### Core Principles

```yaml
1. Governance-First:
   - Every stage has mandatory quality gates
   - Evidence required before stage transition
   - No skipping stages (WHY → WHAT → HOW → BUILD...)

2. Zero Mock Policy:
   - No placeholders in production code
   - Real implementations only
   - Contract-first development (OpenAPI)

3. Design Thinking Integration:
   - User-centered design (5-phase methodology)
   - Evidence-based decisions
   - Continuous validation

4. AI-Human Orchestration:
   - AI accelerates development (96% time savings)
   - Human oversight for critical decisions
   - Multi-provider AI strategy (Ollama primary)

5. Continuous Compliance:
   - Automated validation in CI/CD
   - Real-time compliance dashboards
   - Proactive issue detection
```

### Framework Version History

| Version | Date | Key Changes |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 4.9.0 | Nov 2025 | Complete 10-Stage Lifecycle + Zero Mock |
| 4.8.0 | Oct 2025 | Design Thinking (Pillar 0) + Code Review |
| 4.7.0 | Sep 2025 | Six-Pillar Architecture |
| 4.0.0 | Jan 2025 | Initial SDLC framework |

---

## Six-Pillar Compliance Framework

### Pillar 0: Design Thinking (Foundation)

**Purpose**: Ensure user-centered design through 5-phase methodology.

```yaml
Phase 1 - Empathize:
  - User interviews conducted: ✅ Required (min 5)
  - Pain points documented: ✅ Required
  - Evidence: Interview transcripts, user personas

Phase 2 - Define:
  - Problem statements: ✅ Required
  - How-Might-We questions: ✅ Required
  - Evidence: Problem Statement document

Phase 3 - Ideate:
  - Solution brainstorming: ✅ Required (min 3 options)
  - Feasibility analysis: ✅ Required
  - Evidence: Solution Hypothesis document

Phase 4 - Prototype:
  - Wireframes/mockups: ✅ Required
  - Technical proof-of-concept: ✅ Required
  - Evidence: Design specifications, POC code

Phase 5 - Test:
  - User validation sessions: ✅ Required (min 3)
  - Feedback integration: ✅ Required
  - Evidence: Validation reports, iteration logs
```

**Compliance Metrics**:
- 5-phase evidence: 100%
- User adoption target: 75-90%
- Time savings: 96% (26h → 1h per feature)

### Pillar 1: Zero Mock Policy

**Purpose**: Eliminate placeholders, ensure production-ready code.

```yaml
BANNED Patterns:
  - "// TODO: Implement"
  - "pass # placeholder"
  - "return { mock: true }"
  - "MockData", "FakeService", "StubAPI"
  - "dummy", "fake", "placeholder"

REQUIRED Patterns:
  - Complete implementations with error handling
  - Real database connections (PostgreSQL)
  - Real API integrations (OPA, MinIO via HTTP)
  - Contract-first (OpenAPI validation)

Enforcement:
  - Pre-commit hook: Scans for banned patterns
  - CI/CD: Automated mock detection
  - Code review: Manual verification
```

**Compliance Metrics**:
- Mocks detected: 0 (zero tolerance)
- Real implementations: 100%
- Contract validation: 100%

### Pillar 2: AI-Human Orchestration

**Purpose**: Optimize AI assistance with human oversight.

```yaml
AI-Powered Tasks (Accelerated):
  ✅ Code generation (boilerplate, CRUD)
  ✅ Test generation (unit tests, fixtures)
  ✅ Documentation (docstrings, comments)
  ✅ Code review (initial pass)
  ✅ Compliance scanning

Human-Required Tasks (Critical):
  ✅ Architecture decisions
  ✅ Security implementation
  ✅ Business logic validation
  ✅ Final code approval (2+ reviewers)
  ✅ Gate approvals

AI Provider Strategy:
  Primary: Ollama (api.nqh.vn) - $50/month, <100ms
  Fallback 1: Claude (Anthropic) - $1000/month
  Fallback 2: GPT-4 (OpenAI) - $800/month
  Fallback 3: Rule-based - $0/month
```

**Compliance Metrics**:
- AI time savings: 96%
- Human oversight: 100% for critical paths
- Cost optimization: 95% reduction

### Pillar 3: Quality Governance (Code Review)

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality through tiered review process.

```yaml
Tier 1 - Manual + AI Prompts (Current):
  - Review time: <30 min per PR
  - Quality gates: 100% passing
  - Cost: FREE (67% time savings)

Tier 2 - AI-Powered (Planned):
  - ChatGPT/Claude for initial review
  - Review time: <5 min per PR
  - Cost: $20-100/month (83% savings)

Tier 3 - Automated (Future):
  - CodeRabbit or similar
  - Review time: <2 min per PR
  - Cost: $12-50/month (93% savings)

Review Requirements:
  - Backend: 2 approvers (Tech Lead + Backend Lead)
  - Frontend: 2 approvers (Tech Lead + Frontend Lead)
  - Critical paths: +Security Lead
```

**Compliance Metrics**:
- Code review coverage: 100%
- Quality gate pass rate: 100%
- Review ROI: ≥498%

### Pillar 4: Documentation Permanence

**Purpose**: Maintain comprehensive, living documentation.

```yaml
Required Documentation (Per Stage):
  Stage 00 (WHY): Mission, Problem Statement, Solution Hypothesis
  Stage 01 (WHAT): FRD, API Spec, Data Model
  Stage 02 (HOW): System Architecture, ADRs, Security Baseline
  Stage 03 (BUILD): Sprint Plans, Code Standards, Test Plans
  Stage 04 (TEST): Test Reports, QA Sign-off
  Stage 05 (SHIP): Deployment Guide, Release Notes
  Stage 06-09: Operate, Support, Evolve docs

Documentation Standards:
  - Format: Markdown (CommonMark)
  - Headers: SDLC 4.9 compliant (Version, Status, Authority)
  - Evidence hashes: SHA256 for traceability
  - Review: Required before gate approval
```

**Compliance Metrics**:
- Documentation coverage: 100% per stage
- Header compliance: 100%
- Evidence traceability: 100%

### Pillar 5: Continuous Compliance

**Purpose**: Automate compliance validation and monitoring.

```yaml
CI/CD Pipeline Compliance:
  Pre-commit:
    ✅ Linting (ruff, ESLint)
    ✅ Formatting (black, Prettier)
    ✅ Mock detection (banned patterns)
    ✅ AGPL import scanning

  Build:
    ✅ Type checking (mypy, TypeScript)
    ✅ Unit tests (95%+ coverage)
    ✅ Security scan (Semgrep)
    ✅ SBOM generation (Syft)

  Deploy:
    ✅ Integration tests
    ✅ Vulnerability scan (Grype)
    ✅ Performance benchmarks
    ✅ Gate status validation

Real-time Monitoring:
  - Compliance dashboard (Grafana)
  - Alert thresholds configured
  - Automated escalation
```

**Compliance Metrics**:
- CI/CD compliance: 100%
- Security scan pass: 100%
- Performance budget met: 100%

```

---

## Zero Mock Policy

### Policy Definition

The Zero Mock Policy is a **MANDATORY** requirement for all code in SDLC Orchestrator. This policy was established after the NQH-Bot crisis (2024) where 679 mock implementations led to 78% production failures.

### Banned Patterns

```python
# ❌ BANNED - Will fail pre-commit and CI/CD

# Python
def get_user():
    # TODO: Implement
    pass

def process_payment():
    return {"mock": True, "status": "success"}

class MockDatabase:
    pass

FAKE_DATA = [{"id": 1, "name": "Fake User"}]

# TypeScript
const getProjects = () => {
  // TODO: Connect to API
  return MOCK_PROJECTS;
};

const FakeAuthService = {
  login: () => Promise.resolve({ token: "fake" }),
};
```

### Required Patterns

```python
# ✅ REQUIRED - Production-ready implementation

# Python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.models import User
from app.core.security import verify_password

def get_user(user_id: str, db: Session) -> User | None:
    """
    Retrieve user by ID from database.

    Args:
        user_id: UUID of the user
        db: Database session

    Returns:
        User object if found, None otherwise

    Raises:
        DatabaseError: If database connection fails
    """
    try:
        user = db.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
        if not user or not user.is_active:
            return None
        return user
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
        raise DatabaseError("Failed to retrieve user")
```

```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED - Production-ready implementation

// TypeScript
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import apiClient from '@/api/client';

interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  stage: string;
}

export function useProjects() {
  return useQuery<Project[]>({
    queryKey: ['projects'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await apiClient.get('/projects');
      return response.data;
    },
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });
}
```

### Enforcement Mechanisms

```yaml
1. Pre-commit Hook:
   Location: .pre-commit-config.yaml
   Patterns: mock, fake, dummy, stub, placeholder, TODO
   Action: Block commit

2. CI/CD Pipeline:
   Job: zero-mock-scan
   Tool: grep + custom validator
   Action: Fail build

3. Code Review:
   Checklist item: "Zero Mock Policy verified"
   Required: Manual confirmation

4. Quality Gate:
   Dashboard: Real-time mock count
   Threshold: 0 (zero tolerance)
```
