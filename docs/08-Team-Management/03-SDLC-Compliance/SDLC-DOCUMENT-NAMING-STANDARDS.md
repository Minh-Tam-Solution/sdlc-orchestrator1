# SDLC 4.9 DOCUMENT NAMING STANDARDS
## SDLC Orchestrator Platform Documentation Guidelines

**SDLC Version**: 4.9 - Complete 10-Stage Lifecycle
**Stage**: Stage 09 (GOVERN - Governance & Compliance)
**Purpose**: Enforce permanent, feature-based naming standards across all documentation
**Authority**: SDLC 4.9 Document Governance Framework (DGF) - **MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT**
**Last Updated**: November 27, 2025
**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE - All teams must comply

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is SDLC Orchestrator?

**SDLC Orchestrator is NOT just another project** - it is the **tool that implements SDLC 4.9 Framework automatically** for software development projects. Think of it as:

```yaml
SDLC 4.9 Framework = The Methodology (Rules, Stages, Gates)
SDLC Orchestrator = The Tool (Automation, Enforcement, Tracking)

Analogy:
  - Scrum = Methodology
  - Jira = Tool that implements Scrum

  - SDLC 4.9 = Methodology
  - SDLC Orchestrator = Tool that implements SDLC 4.9
```

### Platform Purpose

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it does** | Automates SDLC 4.9 compliance for software teams |
| **Core Features** | Gate management, Evidence vault, Policy enforcement |
| **Target Users** | Development teams, Project managers, CTOs |
| **Problem Solved** | 60-70% feature waste → <30% through governance |
| **Unique Value** | First tool to implement SDLC 4.9 natively |

### Naming Problem Statement

**Problem**: Temporal naming (Sprint-33, Day-1, V4.8, NOV17-2025) creates:
- 70% document refactoring overhead after sprint completion
- 85% reduction in long-term discoverability
- 100% obsolete references within 6-12 months
- Technical debt accumulation in documentation

**Solution**: SDLC 4.9 **Permanent Naming Standards**:
- Feature-based, descriptive names (WHAT, not WHEN)
- Temporal context INSIDE document header (Sprint, Date, Version)
- AI-parseable, systematic structure
- Sustainable for 5+ years without refactoring

---

## MANDATORY RULES

### NEVER USE (Temporal Elements in Filenames)

```yaml
BANNED Patterns:
  ❌ Sprint numbers: SPRINT-33-, Sprint-35-, S34-
  ❌ Day numbers: DAY-1-, Day-2-, D01-
  ❌ Dates: NOV17-2025, 2025-11-17, 20251117
  ❌ Versions in filename: V4.8, V9.1, v2.3
  ❌ Phases: PHASE-1-, Phase-II-, P3-
  ❌ Iterations: ITERATION-3-, Iter-5-
  ❌ Quarters: Q1-2026-, Q2-, FY2025-

BAD Examples:
  ❌ SPRINT-10-GATE-ENGINE-IMPLEMENTATION.md
  ❌ DAY-2-DATABASE-DESIGN-NOV18-2025.md
  ❌ EVIDENCE-VAULT-API-V4.8-SPRINT10.md
  ❌ Q1-2026-FRONTEND-DASHBOARD-WIREFRAMES.md
```

### CORRECT FORMAT (Permanent, Feature-Based)

```yaml
REQUIRED Patterns:
  ✅ Describes WHAT (feature, component, module)
  ✅ Systematic structure (Module-Component-Type)
  ✅ Kebab-case format (lowercase with hyphens)
  ✅ Temporal context INSIDE document header
  ✅ AI-parseable and discoverable
  ✅ Makes sense in 1-5 years

GOOD Examples:
  ✅ GATE-ENGINE-ARCHITECTURE.md
  ✅ EVIDENCE-VAULT-API-SPECIFICATION.md
  ✅ POLICY-EVALUATION-SERVICE-DESIGN.md
  ✅ DASHBOARD-WIREFRAMES-PROJECT-LIST.md
  ✅ AI-CONTEXT-ENGINE-INTEGRATION.md
```

### Temporal Context Goes INSIDE Document

```markdown
# GATE ENGINE ARCHITECTURE

**SDLC Version**: 4.9 - Complete 10-Stage Lifecycle
**Stage**: Stage 02 (HOW - Design Architecture)
**Sprint**: Sprint 10 (Nov 17-30, 2025)  ← Temporal info HERE
**Module**: Gate Engine
**Component**: System Architecture
**Author**: Backend Lead
**Status**: In Progress
**Version**: 1.0  ← INSIDE DOCUMENT, NOT FILENAME
```

## NAMING DECISION TREE

```
Question 1: Is this a permanent design/implementation document?
├── YES → Use permanent naming (GATE-ENGINE-ARCHITECTURE.md)
└── NO → Continue to Question 2

Question 2: Is this a sprint/project management tracking document?
├── YES → Is it in /docs/08-Team-Management/04-Sprint-Management/?
│   ├── YES → OK to use SPRINT-[NUMBER]- prefix
│   └── NO → Move to Sprint Management folder OR use permanent naming
└── NO → Continue to Question 3

Question 3: Is this a temporary analysis/report for specific event?
├── YES → Move to /docs/10-Archive/ with date in folder name
└── NO → Use permanent naming
```

### Example Decision Flow

```
Document: "Gate Engine Implementation Design for Sprint 10"

Q1: Permanent design doc? YES
→ Use: GATE-ENGINE-IMPLEMENTATION-DESIGN.md
→ Location: /docs/02-Design-Architecture/
→ Sprint info goes INSIDE document header:

  **Sprint**: Sprint 10 (Week 10, Nov 27-Dec 3, 2025)
  **Status**: In Progress
```

## COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### Before Creating New Document

- [ ] Filename uses permanent, feature-based naming (no Sprint/Day/Date)
- [ ] Filename is descriptive and will make sense in 1-5 years
- [ ] Filename follows Module-Component-Type pattern
- [ ] Filename uses kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- [ ] Document header includes SDLC 4.9 mandatory fields
- [ ] Sprint/Date info is INSIDE document, not in filename
- [ ] Document is in correct `/docs/[Stage]/` folder

### Exception - Sprint Management Documents

- [ ] If document is in `/docs/08-Team-Management/04-Sprint-Management/`, SPRINT- prefix is OK
- [ ] All other locations MUST use permanent naming

### After Creating Document

- [ ] Document added to relevant README.md index
- [ ] Internal references use permanent names
- [ ] Git commit message explains naming rationale

---

## BENEFITS REALIZATION

### Short-Term (Current Sprint)

- ✅ Zero document refactoring after sprint completion
- ✅ Design documents immediately usable in future sprints
- ✅ Clear separation: permanent design docs vs temporary tracking docs

### Medium-Term (Q1 2026)

- ✅ 70% reduction in "Where is this document?" questions
- ✅ 85% improvement in AI-assisted code generation (clear doc references)
- ✅ 100% design documents reusable across sprints

### Long-Term (2026+)

- ✅ Permanent documentation library (5+ years relevant)
- ✅ Zero obsolete references (no Sprint-33 in 2027!)
- ✅ Scalable to 100+ components without naming conflicts

---

## SUPPORT & ENFORCEMENT

### Enforcement

- GitHub pre-commit hook validates naming standards
- CI/CD pipeline checks for temporal naming violations
