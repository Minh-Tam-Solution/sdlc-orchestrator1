## 🚨 BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Blocker 1: Team Assignment Delay (CRITICAL)

**Risk**: If team not assigned by EOD Jan 17, Week 6 kickoff (Jan 20) will be delayed
**Impact**: +1 week additional delay → End date: Apr 25 (instead of Apr 18)
**Mitigation**: Engineering Manager to prioritize by EOD today (Jan 17)

### Blocker 2: Team Member Unavailability

**Risk**: Preferred candidates may be committed to other projects
**Mitigation Options**:
1. **Option A**: Swap team members from Sprint 70 (if Sprint 70 can be delayed)
2. **Option B**: Use fallback candidates (3rd choice per role)
3. **Option C**: Reduce scope to 3 artifacts (BRS+MRP+VCR only, skip LPS/MTS/CRP)

**Decision Authority**: CTO + Engineering Manager (joint decision)

### Blocker 3: Skill Gap (Ollama Integration)

**Risk**: Backend Dev may not have Ollama experience
**Mitigation**:
- Tech Lead to provide 2-hour hands-on training (Monday Jan 20, 1pm)
- Ollama API documentation available (api.nhatquangholding.com/docs)
- Claude API fallback ready (if Ollama integration takes >2 days)
