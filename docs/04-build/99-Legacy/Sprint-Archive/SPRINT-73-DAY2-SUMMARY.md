   - Planning Review (01-PLAN)
   - Design Review (02-DESIGN)
   - Code Review (03-BUILD)
   - Test Review (05-TEST)
   - Deploy Approval (06-DEPLOY)

2. ✅ **Integration Test:** Verify `gates_created` response field equals 5

3. ✅ **Team Templates Test:** Custom team templates override defaults

4. ✅ **Skip Option Test:** `skip_auto_creation=true` creates 0 gates

---

## 🌐 Cross-Browser Testing

**Playwright Configuration:** 5 browsers configured
- ✅ **Chromium** (Desktop Chrome)
- ✅ **Firefox** (Desktop Firefox)
- ✅ **WebKit** (Desktop Safari)
- ✅ **Mobile Chrome** (Pixel 5 viewport)
- ✅ **Mobile Safari** (iPhone 12 viewport)

**Test Execution:**
Each test suite runs on ALL 5 browsers automatically via `playwright.config.ts`

**Verified:**
- Teams page renders correctly on all browsers
- Team creation works on all browsers
- Responsive design validated (mobile + desktop)
