## 📋 Sprint Backlog

### Critical Fixes (P2 - Day 1)

**Owner**: Backend Lead + CTO Review

#### Task 1.1: CORS Wildcard Lock Down ⚠️ CRITICAL

```yaml
Priority: P2 (Blocker for production)
Effort: 2 hours
Owner: Backend Lead
Reviewer: CTO

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Remove CORS wildcard methods (no `allow_methods=["*"]`)
  - [ ] Restrict to specific methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS
  - [ ] Lock CORS origins to production domains:
      - https://sdlc.nqh.vn
      - https://sdlc-api.nqh.vn
  - [ ] Add environment-based CORS config:
      - Dev: localhost:5173, localhost:8000
      - Staging: staging URLs
      - Production: production URLs only
  - [ ] Write unit tests for CORS headers
  - [ ] CTO review + approval

Implementation:
  File: backend/app/core/config.py
  Change:
    # BEFORE (INSECURE)
    CORS_ORIGINS = ["*"]
    CORS_METHODS = ["*"]

    # AFTER (SECURE)
    CORS_ORIGINS = [
        "https://sdlc.nqh.vn",
        "https://sdlc-api.nqh.vn"
    ] if ENV == "production" else [
        "http://localhost:5173",
        "http://localhost:8000"
    ]
    CORS_METHODS = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]

Evidence:
  - Updated config file
  - Unit test results
  - CTO approval comment
```

#### Task 1.2: SECRET_KEY Validation ⚠️ CRITICAL

```yaml
Priority: P2 (Blocker for production)
Effort: 2 hours
Owner: Backend Lead
Reviewer: CTO

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Add startup validation for SECRET_KEY
  - [ ] Enforce minimum length: 32 characters
  - [ ] Enforce entropy check (no weak keys like "changeme")
  - [ ] Fail fast with clear error message if invalid
  - [ ] Document key generation in deployment guide:
      `openssl rand -base64 32`
  - [ ] Add validation for JWT_SECRET_KEY
  - [ ] Write unit tests for validation logic
  - [ ] CTO review + approval

Implementation:
  File: backend/app/core/security.py

  def validate_secret_keys() -> None:
      """Validate SECRET_KEY and JWT_SECRET_KEY on startup."""
      from app.core.config import settings
      import secrets

      # Check SECRET_KEY
      if not settings.SECRET_KEY:
          raise ValueError("SECRET_KEY is not set in environment")

      if len(settings.SECRET_KEY) < 32:
          raise ValueError(
              "SECRET_KEY must be at least 32 characters. "
              "Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32"
          )

      # Check for weak keys
      weak_keys = ["changeme", "secret", "password", "admin", "test"]
      if any(weak in settings.SECRET_KEY.lower() for weak in weak_keys):
          raise ValueError(
              "SECRET_KEY appears weak. "
              "Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32"
          )

      # Repeat for JWT_SECRET_KEY
      # ... (similar checks)

  # Call in main.py startup event
  @app.on_event("startup")
  async def startup_event():
      validate_secret_keys()
      logger.info("Secret keys validated successfully")

Evidence:
  - Startup validation code
  - Unit test results (weak key detection)
  - Deployment guide update
  - CTO approval comment
```

#### Task 1.3: CSP unsafe-inline Removal ⚠️ P2

```yaml
Priority: P2 (Security hardening)
Effort: 3 hours
Owner: Backend Lead
Reviewer: Security Lead

Acceptance Criteria:
  - [ ] Remove `unsafe-inline` from CSP for API docs if feasible
  - [ ] If not feasible (Swagger UI requirement):
      - Document compensating controls
      - Add nonce-based CSP for inline scripts
      - Restrict API docs to authenticated users only
      - Add separate CSP policy for /docs route
  - [ ] Test Swagger UI functionality after CSP change
  - [ ] Security Lead review + approval

Implementation:
  File: backend/app/middleware/security_headers.py

  # Separate CSP for API docs
  @app.middleware("http")
  async def add_security_headers(request: Request, call_next):
      response = await call_next(request)

      # Strict CSP for main app
      if not request.url.path.startswith("/docs"):
          response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = (
              "default-src 'self'; "
              "script-src 'self'; "
              "style-src 'self'; "
              # ... no unsafe-inline
          )
      else:
          # Relaxed CSP for Swagger UI (documented exception)
          response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = (
              "default-src 'self'; "
              "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "
              "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "
              # Add nonce if possible
          )

      return response

Evidence:
  - Updated CSP policy
  - Swagger UI functionality test
