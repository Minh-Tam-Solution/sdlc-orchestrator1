# SPEC-0018: AGENTS.md Technical Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the **governance requirements** for AGENTS.md Technical Implementation - a two-layer architecture combining static context files with dynamic overlay injection for AI-assisted development.

**Key Governance Principles**:
- Static AGENTS.md files provide baseline AI context (≤150 lines)
- Dynamic overlays inject real-time gate status, learnings, and incidents
- Multi-channel delivery ensures AI tools receive current context
- Secret detection prevents credential leakage

**Business Value**:
- 40% reduction in AI hallucinations (tested in pilot)
- Real-time context vs. stale static files
- Enforcement through OPA policy guards

> **Implementation Reference**: For technical implementation details (service classes, database schemas, API endpoints), see SDLC-Orchestrator documentation.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This specification defines the **governance requirements** for AGENTS.md Technical Implementation - a two-layer architecture combining static context files with dynamic overlay injection for AI-assisted development.

**Industry Context**: AGENTS.md has become the **de facto standard** for AI context (60K+ repos on GitHub), but existing implementations are **static and manual**. SDLC Orchestrator differentiates by adding **dynamic overlay** capabilities that inject real-time project state, quality gates status, and learning feedback into AI context.

### 1.2 Background

**Static AGENTS.md (Industry Standard)**:
- Manually created markdown file (≤150 lines recommended)
- Checked into repository root
- Contains: Project overview, architecture principles, coding standards, common patterns
- **Limitation**: Stale context (manual updates required)

**Dynamic Overlay (SDLC Orchestrator Innovation)**:
- Real-time context injection based on current gate status, recent learnings, active incidents
- Delivered via 4 channels: PR comments, CLI output, GitHub Check Runs, API responses
- **Advantage**: Always up-to-date, actionable guidance

### 1.3 Strategic Value

**Moat Analysis** (vs. Static AGENTS.md):

| Capability | Static AGENTS.md | SDLC Orchestrator Dynamic |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Context Freshness** | Manual updates (days/weeks lag) | Real-time (≤5s after gate change) |
| **Enforcement** | Guidance only | OPA policy guards (hard block) |
| **Learning Loop** | No feedback mechanism | PR reviews → Hints → AI improvement |
| **Gate Integration** | Not aware of gates | Gate-aware context ("G3 passed, strict mode") |
| **Evidence Trail** | No audit | Full lineage (overlay → evidence → gate) |
| **Multi-Channel** | File-only | PR comment + CLI + Check Run + API |

**ROI**: 40% reduction in AI hallucinations (tested in BFlow pilot) by providing real-time constraints.
