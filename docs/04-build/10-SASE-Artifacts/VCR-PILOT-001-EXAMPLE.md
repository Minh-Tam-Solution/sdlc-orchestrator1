### 5.2 Recommendations for Phase 3-Rollout

**MRP Creation**:
1. 💡 Use MRP-PILOT-001 as template (save 2-3 hours per project)
2. 💡 Automate metrics collection (dashboard for real-time tracking)
3. 💡 Create MRP checklist (5 evidence types, 10 key metrics)

**VCR Workflow**:
1. 💡 Schedule dedicated review time (4 hours for MRP review)
2. 💡 Involve all 3 roles (CTO + Tech Lead + PM/PO) for consistency
3. 💡 Document decision rationale immediately (while fresh in memory)

**SASE Maturity**:
1. 💡 Phase 3: Focus on Level 1 (BRS + MRP + VCR) for all 5 projects
2. 💡 Phase 4: Introduce Level 2 (+ LPS + MTS) for 2 advanced projects
3. 💡 Q2 2026: Introduce Level 3 (+ CRP) for Vibecode CLI (proactive consultation)
