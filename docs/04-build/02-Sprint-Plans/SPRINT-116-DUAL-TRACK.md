    - all_checks_pass
```

### Day-by-Day Plan

#### Day 4: CEO Time Measurement

**Measurement Protocol**:
```yaml
CEO Time Tracking:

  Method 1: Self-Report
    - CEO tracks hours spent on PR reviews
    - Daily log for Sprint 116 week

  Method 2: Calendar Analysis
    - Review meeting invites for PR reviews
    - Calculate time in review sessions

  Method 3: System Metrics
    - Count PRs requiring CEO decision
    - Average time per decision
    - Auto-approved vs manual ratio

Target:
  Baseline (Sprint 114): 40h/week (estimated)
  Sprint 115: 30h/week (25% reduction)
  Sprint 116: 10h/week (75% reduction)

Report Template:
  CEO Time Report - Sprint 116 Week
  =====================================
  Total PRs submitted: [N]
  Auto-approved (Green): [N] ([%])
  Tech Lead approved: [N] ([%])
  CEO reviewed: [N] ([%])

  CEO time spent:
    - PR reviews: [X] hours
    - Decision queue: [Y] hours
    - Override approvals: [Z] hours
    - TOTAL: [X+Y+Z] hours

  Target: 10 hours
  Actual: [___] hours
  Variance: [___]%
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] CEO time measured for full week
- [ ] Target achieved or gap analyzed
- [ ] Improvement plan if target missed

#### Day 5: Launch Announcement

**Announcement Content**:
```markdown
# SDLC Orchestrator: Anti-Vibecoding FULL Mode Live

**Date**: February 21, 2026
**Version**: Governance System v1.0

## What's New

The SDLC Orchestrator governance system is now in FULL enforcement mode:

### Automatic Quality Gates
- All PRs evaluated by Vibecoding Index
- Green PRs (index < 30) auto-approved
- Red PRs (index > 80) require CEO review

### Developer Experience
- Auto-generation of intent, ownership, context
- <5 minute compliance time
- >70% first-pass rate

### CEO Time Savings
- Before: 40 hours/week on PR reviews
- After: 10 hours/week (75% reduction)

## How It Works

1. **Submit PR** → Governance check runs automatically
2. **Index Calculated** → Vibecoding Index (0-100)
3. **Routing Decision** → Green/Yellow/Orange/Red
4. **Auto-Action** → Approve, require review, or block
