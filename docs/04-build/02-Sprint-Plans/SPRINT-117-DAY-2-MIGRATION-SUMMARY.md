---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **BDD Format Clarity**: GIVEN-WHEN-THEN makes requirements testable and unambiguous
2. **Tier-Specific Sections**: Clear differentiation of features per tier helps product packaging
3. **Concise Architectural Specs**: Focus on WHAT and WHY (requirements/decisions) instead of HOW (implementation) keeps specs maintainable
4. **ADR Linking**: Cross-references to architecture decisions provide context without duplication

### Challenges
1. **Long Source Documents**: System Architecture (1,084 lines) required significant condensation while preserving key information
2. **Policy Spec Detail**: Policy Guards had extensive Rego code examples - migrated to appendix references instead of inline
3. **Tier Requirement Consistency**: Ensuring tier requirements are consistent across all 3 specs required careful review

### Recommendations for Day 3-5
1. **Prioritize Conciseness**: For large specs (>500 lines), focus on requirements and acceptance criteria, defer implementation details to separate docs
2. **Template Reuse**: Use SPEC-0003/0004/0005 as templates for Day 3-5 migrations (structure is now proven)
3. **Parallel Validation**: As specs are migrated, validate cross-references to already-migrated specs (prevent broken links)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Day 3 - Jan 29, 2026)
1. Begin P1 spec migration (2 specs: ADR-022, AGENTS-MD Technical)
2. Use SPEC-0003 (ADR format) as template for ADR-022
3. Use SPEC-0004 (technical spec) as template for AGENTS-MD Technical

### Short-Term (Day 4-5 - Jan 30-31, 2026)
1. Complete remaining 5 P1 specs (ADR-036, Codegen Service, IR Processor, ADR-012, Validation Pipeline)
2. Daily migration summary after each day (similar to this report)

### Medium-Term (Week 2 - Feb 3-7, 2026)
1. Migrate 8 P2+P3 specs (Teams, Planning, Governance Metrics, AGENTS-MD Integration, Feedback Learning, Conformance Check)
2. Update Section 7: Quality Assurance System (Anti-Vibecoding documentation)
3. Update CONTENT-MAP.md navigation
4. Validate all cross-references
5. Create Sprint 117 completion report

## Track 2: Spec-First POC Completion (Day 2 Afternoon)

### POC Deliverables (5 Clean Files)

**Objective**: Create machine-readable governance specifications following pure methodology principle (zero executable code).

**Result**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** - All 5 POC files created and validated:
1. `spec/evidence/spec-frontmatter-schema.json` - JSON Schema for spec validation
2. `spec/controls/anti-vibecoding.yaml` - 3 controls (AVC-001/002/003)
3. `spec/gates/gates.yaml` - 5 gates (G0-G4) with tier requirements
4. `spec/VERSIONING.md` - Framework vs schema versioning strategy
5. `docs/SPEC-FIRST-POC-VALIDATION.md` - Manual validation checklist

**Total Lines**: ~1,350 lines of pure YAML/JSON/Markdown specifications

### POC Validation Summary

**Manual Validation Checklist Results**:
- **Score**: 23/25 checks PASSED (92%)
- **Status**: ✅ APPROVED FOR COMMIT
- **Purity Compliance**: 100% (zero .py/.ts/.sh files)
- **Platform-Agnostic**: 100% (no GitHub/Git/platform-specific references)
- **Deferred**: 2 checks (SPEC-0001/0002 frontmatter validation - files not yet created)

**Validation Breakdown**:
- ✅ Purity Checks (3/3): File types, automation blocks, platform references
- ✅ Schema Validation (2/2): JSON syntax, YAML syntax
- ⏳ Frontmatter Validation (0/2): Deferred until SPEC-0001/SPEC-0002 created
- ✅ Control Definitions (3/3): Structure, IDs, platform-agnostic language
- ✅ Gates Definitions (3/3): Structure, semantic-only, tier requirements
- ✅ Versioning Documentation (6/6): All sections present and documented

### Expert Critique Compliance

**5 Critical Purity Violations Addressed**:
- ✅ **Issue A**: Removed API/automation blocks from gates.yaml
- ✅ **Issue B**: No Python validation scripts (manual checklist only)
- ✅ **Issue C**: Constrained scope to exactly 5 files
- ✅ **Issue D**: Platform-agnostic language (measurement_semantics instead of Git/GitHub)
- ✅ **Issue E**: Explicit versioning rules documented (spec/VERSIONING.md)

### Key Design Decisions

**Pure Methodology Compliance**:
- Framework = WHAT (requirements, specifications)
- Orchestrator = HOW (automation, implementation)
- Zero executable code in Framework repository
- All automation deferred to Week 2 (Orchestrator CLI tools)

**Platform-Agnostic Language**:
```yaml
# Before (Platform-Specific):
measurement: "Git commit Co-Authored-By headers"

# After (Platform-Agnostic):
measurement_semantics: |
  Percentage of code contributions where AI assistance is
  explicitly declared in commit metadata or PR description.
evidence_type: "CODE_CONTRIBUTION_METADATA"
```

**Semantic-Only Gates**:
```yaml
# Removed (Automation):
automation:
  gate_evaluation_api: "POST /api/v1/gates/evaluate"

# Kept (Semantic):
failure_consequence: "blocking"
```

### Version Correction

**Framework Version**: 6.0.0 (In Development)
- User feedback: "chúng ta vẫn giữ phiên bản SDLC 6.0 nhé, chưa lên 6.1"
- Translation: "we still keep SDLC version 6.0, not upgrading to 6.1 yet"
- Rationale: Framework 6.0 still in development, not officially released
- **Corrected files**: spec/controls/anti-vibecoding.yaml, spec/gates/gates.yaml, spec/VERSIONING.md
