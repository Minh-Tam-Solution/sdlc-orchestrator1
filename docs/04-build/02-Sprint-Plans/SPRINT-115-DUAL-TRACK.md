# Sprint 115: Dual-Track Execution Plan
## Framework 6.0 Templates + Anti-Vibecoding SOFT Mode

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Dates**: February 10-14, 2026 (5 days)
**Status**: PLANNED (Pending Sprint 114 Completion)
**Framework**: SDLC 5.3.0 → 6.0 (OpenSpec-inspired Upgrade)
**Prerequisites**: Sprint 114 metrics pass Go/No-Go gate

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 115 continues dual-track execution:
- **Track 1 (40%)**: Framework 6.0 Template Development
- **Track 2 (60%)**: Anti-Vibecoding SOFT Mode Enforcement

Key milestone: First blocking enforcement of governance rules.

---

## Sprint 114 → 115 Gate

```yaml
Go/No-Go Criteria (from Sprint 114):
  ✓ Developer friction < 10 minutes per PR
  ✓ False positive rate < 20%
  ✓ No critical bugs in WARNING mode
  ✓ Team feedback positive (>50% satisfied)

If ALL pass → Proceed to SOFT enforcement
If ANY fail → Extend WARNING mode, defer SOFT to Sprint 116
```

#### Day 5: Context Authority Methodology

**Purpose**: Document AGENTS.md patterns for Framework 6.0

**Document Structure**:
```markdown
# Context Authority Methodology

## 1. Overview
How AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md provides context to AI agents.

## 2. Context Injection Patterns
### 2.1 Static Context (Manual)
- Project-level CLAUDE.md
- Team conventions
- ADR summaries

### 2.2 Dynamic Context (Automated)
- Gate status updates
- Current stage information
- Known issues/blockers

## 3. Context Authority Engine (Orchestrator)
### 3.1 Architecture
How Orchestrator injects dynamic context.

### 3.2 Integration Points
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline
- IDE extensions

## 4. Best Practices
- Keep context focused
- Update on gate transitions
- Avoid information overload

## 5. Migration from Manual to Automated
Phased approach for existing projects.
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Context Authority Methodology document
- [ ] Integration with Orchestrator documented
- [ ] Patterns extracted from OpenSpec research

## Track 2: Orchestrator SOFT Enforcement (60%)

### Goals
1. Enable SOFT enforcement mode
2. Block critical violations (Red PRs)
3. Measure developer friction accurately

### Enforcement Rules

```yaml
SOFT Mode Rules:

  BLOCK (Cannot Merge):
    - missing_ownership: No @owner header
    - missing_intent: No intent document
    - vibecoding_index_red: Index > 80
    - security_scan_fail: Critical vulnerabilities
    - stage_violation: Work in wrong stage

  WARN (Can Merge with Override):
    - stale_agents_md: >7 days since update
    - missing_adr_linkage: No related ADRs
    - vibecoding_index_orange: Index 61-80
    - missing_tests: Coverage below threshold

  AUTO_APPROVE (No Review Needed):
    - vibecoding_index_green: Index < 30
    - all_checks_pass: No violations detected
```

### Day-by-Day Plan

#### Day 1: Enable SOFT Mode

**Tasks**:
```bash
# 1. Update environment configuration
export GOVERNANCE_MODE=SOFT

# 2. Deploy enforcement rules
# backend/app/config/governance_rules.yaml
governance:
  mode: SOFT
  rules:
    block:
      - missing_ownership
      - missing_intent
      - vibecoding_index_red
      - security_scan_fail
    warn:
      - stale_agents_md
      - missing_adr_linkage
      - vibecoding_index_orange

# 3. Update GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Governance Check (SOFT)
  run: |
    result=$(curl -X POST $ORCHESTRATOR_URL/api/v1/governance/evaluate)
    if [[ $(echo $result | jq '.block') == "true" ]]; then
      echo "::error::Governance BLOCKED - Critical violations"
      exit 1
    fi
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] SOFT mode active
- [ ] First blocked PR observed
- [ ] Override mechanism working

#### Day 2-4: Developer Friction Measurement

**Metrics Collection**:
```yaml
Quantitative Metrics:
  Time to Compliance:
    - Time from PR creation to governance pass
    - Target: < 5 minutes average

  First-Pass Rate:
    - % of PRs that pass on first attempt
    - Target: > 70%

  Block Rate:
    - % of PRs blocked by SOFT mode
    - Target: < 20%

  Override Rate:
    - % of warned PRs that use override
    - Target: < 30%

Qualitative Feedback:
  Daily Survey:
    1. How long did governance compliance take today?
    2. Were any blocks frustrating/incorrect?
    3. Did auto-generation help?
    4. Suggestions for improvement?
```

**Daily Analysis**:
```yaml
Day 2:
  - Review first 5 blocked PRs
  - Identify false positives
  - Adjust thresholds if needed

Day 3:
  - Analyze friction patterns
  - Interview developers with issues
  - Document improvement ideas

Day 4:
  - Address top 3 friction points
  - Test fixes in staging
  - Prepare Go/No-Go report
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] 20+ PRs evaluated in SOFT mode
- [ ] Developer friction survey completed
- [ ] Friction points documented and addressed

#### Day 5: Go/No-Go Decision for FULL Mode

**Decision Criteria**:
```yaml
GO to FULL Enforcement (Sprint 116) if:
  - First-pass rate > 70%
  - Blocked PRs < 20%
  - Developer satisfaction > 60%
  - No critical bugs discovered
  - CEO time showing improvement trend

STAY in SOFT Mode if:
  - Any metric below threshold
  - Critical issues discovered
  - Team requests more tuning

ROLLBACK to WARNING Mode if:
  - Developer friction > 15 minutes
  - False positive rate > 30%
  - Team morale significantly impacted
```

**Sprint 115 Report Template**:
```yaml
Sprint 115 Metrics Report:

Track 1 (Framework 6.0):
  Templates Completed: [X/3]
  CTO Approval: [Yes/No]
  Ready for Sprint 116: [Yes/No]

Track 2 (Anti-Vibecoding):
  Mode: SOFT
  PRs Evaluated: [N]
  First-Pass Rate: [%]
  Block Rate: [%]
  Developer Friction: [minutes]
  Developer Satisfaction: [%]

Go/No-Go Decision:

  Rationale: [...]

CPO Conditions Check:
  Track 2 Priority: [Met/Not Met]
  CEO Time Trend: [Improving/Flat/Worse]
  Context Switching: [Manageable/Problematic]
