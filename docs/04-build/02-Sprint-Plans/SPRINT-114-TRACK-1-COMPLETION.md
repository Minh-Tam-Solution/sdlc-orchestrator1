# Sprint 114 Track 1 Completion Report
## Framework 6.0 Planning Phase - COMPLETE

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: January 28, 2026
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Ahead of Schedule)
**Author**: PM/PJM Team
**Reviewer**: CTO

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Sprint 114 Track 1 has been successfully completed, delivering the foundational documentation and templates for SDLC Framework 6.0. The track focused on establishing a unified specification standard that bridges the gap between rapid AI-assisted development (via OpenSpec patterns) and enterprise governance requirements (via SDLC methodology).

The OpenSpec POC evaluation scored 8.3/10, validating its technical soundness for proposal generation while identifying governance gaps that SDLC 6.0 addresses. The comparison matrix analysis yielded a clear recommendation: **HYBRID APPROACH** (8.6/10 weighted score) - leveraging OpenSpec for rapid planning and SDLC 6.0 for governance integration.

Key outcomes include the SDLC-Specification-Standard.md template (650+ LOC) with full tier-aware requirements, three example specifications demonstrating LITE/STANDARD/PROFESSIONAL implementations, and comprehensive POC documentation for the Week 8 Gate decision. Track 1 deliverables provide the methodology foundation that Track 2 (Orchestrator) will automate in Sprint 115-119.

All Day 1-4 objectives achieved ahead of schedule. Ready for CTO review and Sprint 115 handoff.
