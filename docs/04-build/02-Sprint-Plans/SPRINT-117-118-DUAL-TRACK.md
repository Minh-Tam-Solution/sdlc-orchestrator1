    - Document rationale for changes

  Routing Logic:
    - Review Green/Yellow boundary (30)
    - Review Yellow/Orange boundary (60)
    - Review Orange/Red boundary (80)

  Kill Switch:
    - Review rejection rate threshold (80%)
    - Review latency threshold (500ms)
    - Adjust if too sensitive/lenient
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] All P0/P1 bugs fixed
- [ ] Thresholds documented

  - Framework migration needs support
```

#### Context Authority Engine MVP
