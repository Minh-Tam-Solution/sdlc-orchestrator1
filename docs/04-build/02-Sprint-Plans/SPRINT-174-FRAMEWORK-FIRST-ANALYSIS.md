# Sprint 174: Framework-First Violation Analysis
## CTO Review — February 16, 2026

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Original Plan Violates SDLC 6.0.5 Core Principle

### The Problem

**Original Plan**:
```
Days 1-2:  CLAUDE.md enhancement (Orchestrator)      ❌ TOOL FIRST
Days 3-7:  Prompt caching (Orchestrator)             ❌ TOOL FIRST  
Days 6-7:  MCP upgrade (Orchestrator)                ❌ TOOL FIRST
Days 8-10: Framework enhancements (Framework)        ❌ METHODOLOGY LAST
```

**This is backwards.** You're building the **automation** before defining the **methodology**.

---

## ✅ CORRECTED APPROACH

### Corrected Plan:
```
Days 1-3:  Framework standards (Framework)           ✅ METHODOLOGY FIRST
Days 4-5:  CLAUDE.md implementation (Orchestrator)   ✅ TOOL SECOND
Days 6:    ADR alignment (Documentation)             ✅ DOCUMENTATION THIRD
Days 7-8:  Prompt caching (Orchestrator)             ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE FOURTH
Days 9:    MCP upgrade (Orchestrator)                ✅ INTEGRATION FIFTH
Day 10:    ADRs + Prototypes (Both)                  ✅ EXPANSION SIXTH
```

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Day | ORIGINAL PLAN (Wrong) | CORRECTED PLAN (Right) |
|-----|----------------------|------------------------|
| **1** | Create Orchestrator CLAUDE.md (2K lines) | 📚 **Framework**: Document CLAUDE.md Standard (3-tier structure) |
| **2** | Orchestrator CLAUDE.md (continued) | 📚 **Framework**: Document Autonomous Codegen Methodology |
| **3** | Prompt caching: Redis architecture | 📚 **Framework**: Document MRP Template |
| **4** | Prompt caching: API integration | 🔧 **Orchestrator**: Create CLAUDE.md (PRO tier, 2K lines) following Framework standard |
| **5** | Prompt caching: Monitoring | 🔧 **Orchestrator**: Create Framework repo CLAUDE.md (LITE tier) |
| **6** | MCP service upgrade (start) | 📝 **Documentation**: Revise ADR-054 to reference Framework standards |
| **7** | MCP service upgrade (finish) | 🔧 **Orchestrator**: Context cache service implementation |
| **8** | ADR-055 (no Framework basis) | 🔧 **Orchestrator**: Integrate caching into codegen + CLI |
| **9** | Browser agent (no Framework basis) | 🔧 **Orchestrator**: MCP service refactor (AsyncExitStack) |
| **10** | Framework enhancements (too late!) | 📝 **Both**: ADR-055 + Browser agent prototype + cleanup |

## Why This Matters

### Framework-First Principle (SDLC 6.0.5 Section 3.2)

> **"Every capability in SDLC Orchestrator must first exist as a documented pattern in SDLC Enterprise Framework. The Framework is the source of truth; the Orchestrator is the automation layer."**

### Consequences of Violating This Principle

#### Original Plan (Tool-First):
1. **No Standardization**: Orchestrator CLAUDE.md is ad-hoc, not based on proven 3-tier structure
2. **No Reusability**: External adopters can't use CLAUDE.md because there's no Framework template
3. **No Validation**: ADR-055 (Autonomous Codegen) has no methodology basis — we're experimenting in production
4. **No Multiplier Effect**: Framework enhancements on Day 10 don't benefit Days 1-9 work
5. **High Rework Risk**: If Framework review rejects our approach on Day 10, we must redo Days 1-9

#### Corrected Plan (Methodology-First):
1. ✅ **Standardization**: Days 1-3 create Framework standards → Days 4-5 implement in Orchestrator
2. ✅ **Reusability**: External teams can use SDLC Framework templates immediately
3. ✅ **Validation**: ADR-055 references proven methodology from Day 2
4. ✅ **Multiplier Effect**: Every line of Framework docs benefits **all** SDLC 6.0.5 adopters
5. ✅ **Low Rework Risk**: Framework standards reviewed early (Days 1-3) → smooth implementation (Days 4-10)

## Impact on Sprint 174 Deliverables

### Deliverables: Original vs Corrected

| Deliverable | Original Plan | Corrected Plan | Difference |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| **CLAUDE.md Standard** | Day 10 (Framework only, rushed) | Days 1 + 4 (Framework → Orchestrator) | ✅ **Better**: Standard defined first, then implemented |
| **Orchestrator CLAUDE.md** | Days 1-2 (ad-hoc, no standard) | Days 4-5 (follows Framework standard) | ✅ **Better**: Based on proven 3-tier structure |
| **Prompt Caching** | Days 3-7 (no Framework doc) | Days 7-8 (after Framework standards) | ⚠️ **Neutral**: Same code, but better documentation context |
| **MCP Service Upgrade** | Days 6-7 (standalone) | Day 9 (after CLAUDE.md + caching) | ✅ **Better**: Integration happens after foundational work |
| **ADR-055** | Day 8 (no methodology) | Day 10 (references Framework Day 2) | ✅ **Better**: Architecture aligned with Framework |
| **Browser Agent** | Day 9 (prototype only) | Day 10 (prototype only) | ⚠️ **Neutral**: Same scope, different day |
| **Framework Enhancements** | Day 10 (3 docs rushed) | Days 1-3 (3 docs properly reviewed) | ✅ **Better**: Quality over speed |

## Risk Analysis

### Risks of Original Plan

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation (Original) | Mitigation (Corrected) |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Framework rejects Orchestrator CLAUDE.md approach** | 60% | HIGH | Rework Days 1-2 (4 days wasted) | ✅ Framework defines standard on Day 1, <5% rejection risk |
| **CLAUDE.md not reusable by external teams** | 80% | MEDIUM | Document retroactively in Sprint 175 | ✅ Framework template on Day 1 → immediate reusability |
| **ADR-055 lacks methodology basis** | 90% | HIGH | Revise in Sprint 175 after Framework catches up | ✅ Framework doc on Day 2 provides methodology |
| **Prompt caching pattern not standardized** | 50% | LOW | Add to Framework later | ⚠️ Still not standardized, but lower priority |
| **Sprint 174 deliverables are Orchestrator-heavy, Framework-light** | 100% | MEDIUM | Accept technical debt | ✅ 50/50 split: Days 1-3 Framework, Days 4-10 Orchestrator |

### Risks of Corrected Plan

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Framework PRs block Orchestrator work** | 40% | HIGH | ✅ Days 1-3 Framework PRs get same-day review priority |
| **CLAUDE.md scope creep (>3,000 lines)** | 30% | MEDIUM | ✅ Timebox to 2,000 lines, defer extras to Sprint 175 |
| **Framework reviewers unavailable Days 1-3** | 20% | HIGH | ✅ Pre-assign reviewers during Sprint 173 retrospective |

**Verdict**: Corrected plan has **lower overall risk** (3 risks vs 5 risks, all mitigatable).

## Timeline Impact

### Original Plan: 10 Days
- Days 1-2: Orchestrator work
- Days 3-7: Orchestrator work
- Days 8-9: Orchestrator work
- Day 10: Framework work (rushed)

**Total**: 9 days Orchestrator, 1 day Framework (90/10 split)

### Corrected Plan: 10 Days
- Days 1-3: Framework work
- Days 4-5: Orchestrator work (CLAUDE.md)
- Day 6: Documentation work (ADR revision)
- Days 7-8: Orchestrator work (caching)
- Day 9: Orchestrator work (MCP)
- Day 10: Mixed (ADRs + prototypes + cleanup)

**Total**: 3 days Framework, 6 days Orchestrator, 1 day Documentation (30/60/10 split)

**Conclusion**: Corrected plan is **more balanced** and follows Framework-First principle.

## Quality Impact

### Code Quality Comparison

| Metric | Original Plan | Corrected Plan | Winner |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Standards Compliance** | Ad-hoc patterns | Framework-guided patterns | ✅ Corrected |
| **Reusability** | Orchestrator-specific | Framework templates available | ✅ Corrected |
| **Documentation Coverage** | 70% (Framework docs rushed) | 95% (Framework docs first) | ✅ Corrected |
| **External Adoption Readiness** | Sprint 175 (after rework) | Sprint 174 (immediate) | ✅ Corrected |
| **Technical Debt** | HIGH (no methodology basis) | LOW (methodology → tool) | ✅ Corrected |

### Team Velocity Comparison

| Sprint | Original Plan | Corrected Plan | Explanation |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Sprint 174** | 90% velocity (9 days code, 1 day docs) | 95% velocity (balanced work) | Corrected plan has less context switching |
| **Sprint 175** | 70% velocity (rework Framework from 174) | 90% velocity (clean start) | Original plan creates technical debt |
| **Sprint 176** | 85% velocity (recovering from 175) | 90% velocity (steady state) | Corrected plan maintains momentum |

**3-Sprint Average**: Original = 81.7% | Corrected = 91.7% | **Corrected wins by +10%**

## Recommendation

### CTO Decision: **APPROVE CORRECTED PLAN**

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ **Framework-First Compliance**: Follows SDLC 6.0.5 core principle
2. ✅ **Lower Risk**: 3 mitigatable risks vs 5 high-impact risks
3. ✅ **Higher Quality**: Framework-guided patterns vs ad-hoc patterns
4. ✅ **Better Long-Term Velocity**: +10% average velocity over 3 sprints
5. ✅ **Immediate External Adoption**: Framework templates ready on Day 3

**Trade-Offs Accepted**:
- ⚠️ Framework PRs must get same-day review (Days 1-3)
- ⚠️ Orchestrator work starts Day 4 instead of Day 1 (3-day delay)
- ⚠️ Requires Framework reviewers available Days 1-3

**Trade-Offs Rejected** (from original plan):
- ❌ 90/10 Orchestrator/Framework split
- ❌ Framework enhancements rushed on Day 10
- ❌ ADR-055 with no methodology basis
- ❌ Technical debt from tool-first approach

## Appendix: Key Quotes from SDLC 6.0.5

### Framework-First Principle (Section 3.2)

> **"The SDLC Enterprise Framework defines WHAT and WHY — the methodology, principles, and patterns. The SDLC Orchestrator implements HOW — the automation, APIs, and tooling. Every feature in Orchestrator must trace back to a documented pattern in Framework."**

### AI Governance Principle #2 (Section 3.3.2)

> **"Framework-First Approach: Add features to SDLC Framework (methodology) before Orchestrator (automation). This ensures new patterns are validated conceptually before being codified in tools."**

### Quality Assurance System (Section 5.1)

> **"Progressive Routing enforces framework alignment. GREEN (simple changes) can skip framework review. YELLOW/ORANGE (medium complexity) require framework ADR. RED (architectural changes) require framework RFC + board approval."**

**Sprint 174 Classification**: **ORANGE** (Anthropic patterns integration)  
**Requirement**: Framework ADR required → Days 1-3 Framework work is **mandatory**
