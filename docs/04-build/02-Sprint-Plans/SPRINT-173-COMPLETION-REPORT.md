| V1→V2 merge | ✅ DONE | `app/services/governance/context_authority_v2.py` | V2 is SSOT |
| V1 deprecation | ✅ DONE | `context_authority.py` (V1) reports deprecation warning | Graceful migration |
| Route redirection | ✅ DONE | `app/api/routes/context_authority.py` | Routes call V2 |
| V1 deletion | ✅ DONE | V1 file removed | V2 absorbed all functionality |

**LOC Saved**: ~500 (as planned)

**Verdict**: ✅ Strangler Fig pattern executed correctly. Golden tests passing.

#### 2.2 Governance Mode Enforcer Consolidation (Days 11-12)

| Task | Status | Evidence | Notes |

---

## Risk Register — Actuals vs Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | **ACTUAL OUTCOME** |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| DB migration breaks existing gates | HIGH | LOW | ✅ **NO ISSUE**. Alembic handled data migration cleanly. |
| Redis unavailable for idempotency | MEDIUM | LOW | ✅ **NEVER OCCURRED**. Graceful degradation tested manually. |
| State rename breaks client code | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | ✅ **MITIGATED**. Pre-migration search found zero usages of old state names. |
| Golden tests fail on V1→V2 merge | HIGH | MEDIUM | ✅ **MITIGATED**. Used real production data, fixed discrepancies before V1 deletion. |
| Extension SHA256 slow on large files | LOW | LOW | ✅ **NO ISSUE**. Stream-based hashing works well up to 100MB limit. |
| CTO-OVERRIDE label misuse | MEDIUM | LOW | ✅ **NO ISSUE**. Zero abuse attempts. Label governance working. |

**Verdict**: All risks mitigated successfully. Zero production incidents.

---

## Technical Debt Analysis

### ✅ Debt Reduced

| Category | Before Sprint 173 | After Sprint 173 | Delta |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| **LOC (Dead Code)** | +838 LOC waste | 0 LOC | **-838** |
| **Module Sprawl** | 9 non-core modules active | 9 frozen | **-9 active** |
| **Enforcement Duplication** | 2 separate enforcers (~700 LOC) | 1 unified strategy | **-700 duplicated** |
| **Context Authority Versions** | V1 + V2 coexisting (~500 LOC) | V2 only | **-500 duplicated** |
| **Code Review Docs** | 3 scattered guides | 1 SSOT guide | **-2 guides** |

**Total Debt Reduction**: **~2,038 LOC** + **2 doc consolidations** + **9 modules frozen**

### 🟡 Debt Introduced (Temporary)

| Category | Debt | Mitigation | Timeline |
|----------|------|------------|----------|
| **Deprecated Facades** | 2 files (soft/full enforcers) | Scheduled removal Sprint 174 | 1 sprint (acceptable) |
| **Extension Evidence UI** | Incomplete implementation | Sprint 174 polish | 1 sprint |

**Verdict**: Sprint 173 **significantly reduced** technical debt. Temporary debt is **planned** and **time-boxed**.

---

## Framework-First Compliance Assessment

**SDLC 6.0.5 Principle**: Framework (methodology) updates **BEFORE** Orchestrator (automation) implementation.

### Track A (Code) vs Track B (Framework)

| Phase | Track A (Code) | Track B (Framework) | Compliance |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Pre-Phase | State machine + DB (Day 1) | N/A | ✅ Technical foundation |
| Phase 1 | CLI + Extension (Days 2-7) | Code Review consolidation (Days 2-3) | ✅ PARALLEL |
| Phase 1 | ^^ | AI-GOVERNANCE expansion (Day 4) | ✅ PARALLEL |
| Phase 1 | ^^ | Version refs update (Days 5-7) | ✅ PARALLEL |
| Phase 2 | Context Authority merge (Days 8-10) | Framework freeze PR (Day 1, merged before Day 8) | ✅ Framework BEFORE code |
| Phase 3-4 | Freeze + Delete (Day 13) | Framework cleanup complete (Day 7) | ✅ Framework BEFORE code |

**Verdict**: ✅ **FULL COMPLIANCE**. Dual-track execution ensured Framework updates happened **in parallel or before** code changes. Track B completed by Day 7, all major Track A work after Day 7 built on frozen Framework.

**Key Evidence**: Framework freeze PR merged Day 1 **BEFORE** any governance loop code changes. This is the **correct pattern**.

---

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Went Well

1. **Graceful Deprecation Pattern**: Team **exceeded** original plan by implementing deprecated facades instead of breaking deletions. Shows SDLC 6.0.5 mastery.
2. **Dual-Track Execution**: Track A (code) and Track B (Framework) ran in parallel without conflicts.
3. **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Context Authority V1→V2 merge with golden tests prevented regressions.
4. **CI Enforcement**: Frozen module protection via GitHub Actions prevented scope creep.
5. **Test Coverage**: 96% backend coverage (exceeded 95% target).

### 🟡 What Went Okay

1. **Extension Evidence UI**: Deferred to Sprint 174 due to UI/UX polish requirements. Core gate commands work.
2. **Enforcement Matrix Tests**: 12 scenarios implemented (exceeded 8+ target), but documentation could be clearer.

### 🔴 What Went Wrong

1. **Missing Completion Report**: **Team forgot to create Sprint 173 Completion Report** at sprint end. This document was **reconstructed by CTO** on March 15, 2026 during Sprint 174 planning review. **Root Cause**: No Definition of Done checklist for "Create Completion Report" in sprint plan.
   - **Action**: Add "Create Sprint Completion Report" as **mandatory P0 task** in all future sprint plans (Day 14).
   - **Owner**: Tech Lead (accountability for sprint documentation).

2. **Extension Scope Ambiguity**: Evidence submission UI requirements unclear until Day 5. Led to mid-sprint CTO decision to defer.
   - **Action**: Require **UI mockups** for all extension features **before** sprint kickoff.
   - **Owner**: PM + Designer.
