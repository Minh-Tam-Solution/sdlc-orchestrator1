2. Update sdlcctl CLI for spec validation
3. OpenSpec CLI integration (conditional)

### Day-by-Day Plan

#### Day 1-2: Framework Submodule Update

**Submodule Update Tasks**:
```bash
# Update Framework submodule to 6.0.0
cd SDLC-Orchestrator
git submodule update --remote SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
git add SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
git commit -m "chore: Update Framework submodule to 6.0.0"

# Verify alignment
# - Check CLAUDE.md references
# - Update any 5.3.0 mentions to 6.0.0
# - Verify template paths
```

**Alignment Checklist**:
```yaml
Orchestrator Alignment:
  [ ] Framework submodule at v6.0.0
  [ ] CLAUDE.md updated (5.3.0 → 6.0.0)
  [ ] Project documentation aligned
  [ ] API documentation updated
  [ ] Frontend references updated
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] Submodule updated
- [ ] All references aligned
- [ ] No broken imports

#### Day 3-4: sdlcctl spec validate CLI

**CLI Enhancement**:
```yaml
sdlcctl spec validate Command:

  Purpose:
    - Validate spec files against Framework 6.0 format
    - Check YAML frontmatter
    - Verify BDD requirements format
    - Check tier requirements

  Usage:
    sdlcctl spec validate [file|directory]
    sdlcctl spec validate --fix [file|directory]
    sdlcctl spec validate --report

  Validation Rules:
    1. YAML frontmatter present
    2. Required fields: spec_version, status, tier, stage, owner
    3. BDD format for requirements (GIVEN-WHEN-THEN)
    4. Tier-specific requirements present
    5. Related ADRs linked
    6. Acceptance criteria testable

  Output:
    ✓ Security-Baseline.md - VALID
    ✗ API-Specification.md - INVALID
      - Missing: tier field
      - Warning: 2 requirements not in BDD format

  Exit Codes:
    0: All specs valid
    1: Validation errors found
    2: File not found
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
```yaml
Implementation:
  1. Add validation rules to sdlcctl
  2. Implement YAML frontmatter parser
  3. Add BDD format checker
  4. Create --fix option for auto-fix
  5. Add --report option for CI/CD
  6. Write tests (95%+ coverage)
  7. Update CLI documentation
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] sdlcctl spec validate working
- [ ] All validation rules implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

#### Day 5: OpenSpec Integration (Conditional)

**OpenSpec Integration Decision**:
```yaml
Proceed with OpenSpec Integration if:
  - Week 8 Gate decision was "ADOPT"
  - Team comfortable with OpenSpec workflow
  - No blocking issues discovered

Defer OpenSpec Integration if:
  - Week 8 Gate decision was "EXTEND" or "DEFER"
  - Team prefers custom approach
  - Integration complexity too high
```

**If ADOPT (OpenSpec Integration)**:
```yaml
OpenSpec CLI Integration:

  Wrapper Service:
    - Install OpenSpec CLI in Orchestrator environment
    - Create wrapper API endpoint
    - Handle OpenSpec output → Orchestrator format

  API Endpoint:
    POST /api/v1/specs/generate
    {
      "change_description": "Add user authentication with OAuth",
      "project_id": "xxx"
    }

  Response:
    {
      "proposal_md": "...",
      "design_decisions_md": "...",
      "tasks_md": "...",
      "spec_delta_md": "..."
    }

  Integration Points:
    - Planning phase: Use OpenSpec for proposal generation
    - Execution phase: Import to Orchestrator for governance
    - Evidence: Store generated specs in Evidence Vault
```

**If EXTEND (Custom Approach)**:
```yaml
Context Authority V2 Planning:

  Scope:
    - Document current Context Authority V1 features
    - Plan V2 enhancements for Sprint 120+
    - Align with Framework 6.0 templates

  Deliverable:
    - Context Authority V2 specification
    - Sprint 120 plan draft
    - Resource requirements
```

**Exit Criteria**:
- [ ] OpenSpec decision executed (ADOPT/EXTEND/DEFER)
- [ ] Integration/plan documented
- [ ] Sprint 120 direction clear
