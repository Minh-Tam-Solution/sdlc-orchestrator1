## 📈 Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Year 1** (100 teams):
- Marketing spend: $45,000 (development) + $120,000 (Year 1 operations) = $165,000
- Sales team: 1 FTE × $100K = $100,000
- **Total acquisition cost**: $265,000
- **CAC**: $265,000 ÷ 100 teams = **$2,650/team**

**Year 2-3** (Optimized):
- Improved conversion: CAC reduces to **$1,200/team** (referrals, content marketing)

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Average Team**:
- Monthly subscription: $250 (blended average across tiers)
- AI pass-through: $50/month
- **Total monthly**: $300/team
- **Annual value**: $3,600/team
- **Average lifetime**: 36 months (3 years)
- **LTV**: $3,600 × 36 months = **$10,800/team**

**LTV:CAC Ratio**:
- Year 1: $10,800 ÷ $2,650 = **4.08:1** ✅ (Healthy: >3:1)
- Year 2-3: $10,800 ÷ $1,200 = **9:1** 🚀 (Excellent)

### Gross Margin

**Revenue Components**:
- Subscription revenue: 80% (high margin ~85%)
- AI pass-through: 20% (margin ~20%)

**Blended Gross Margin**:
- (80% × 85%) + (20% × 20%) = **72%** ✅

**Industry Benchmark**: SaaS target >70%, we're at 72% ✅

| **Cumulative** | -$1,005K | -$2,421K | -$3,417K | **-$3,417K** |

### Key Milestones

| Milestone | When | ARR | Teams |
|-----------|------|-----|-------|
| **Beta Launch** | Month 4 | $0 | 20 |
| **Paid Launch** | Month 7 | $30K | 30 |
| **100 Teams** | Month 12 | $240K | 100 |

## 💡 Financial Assumptions & Risks

### Key Assumptions

✅ **Market demand validated** (10+ teams confirmed pain point)
✅ **Pricing validated** ($99-$999/month acceptable to ICP)
✅ **Team available** (8.5 FTE committed for 90 days)
✅ **AI costs predictable** (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google pricing stable)
✅ **OSS licensing clear** (legal review Week 2)

### Risk Factors

🔴 **HIGH RISK**:
1. **AI Provider Pricing Changes**: Claude/GPT-4o could increase 2-3x
   - Mitigation: Multi-provider strategy, pass-through pricing
   - **NEW**: NQH AI Platform (qwen2.5-coder:32b) as $0 fallback
2. **OSS License Violations**: AGPL contamination risk
   - Mitigation: Legal review Week 2 (budgeted $75K)
   - **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (Dec 2025)
3. **Competitive Response**: Jira/Linear could add similar features
   - Mitigation: SDLC 5.1.3 IP moat (1-2 years to replicate)
   - **NEW**: AI Safety positioning unique in market

🟡 **MEDIUM RISK**:
4. **Customer Acquisition Cost**: Could be 2x higher than projected
   - Mitigation: Beta users as early advocates, referral program
5. **Churn Rate**: Could be 10% vs 5% if product-market fit weak
   - Mitigation: Design Thinking validation, continuous user feedback

🟢 **LOW RISK**:
6. **Development Timeline**: 90 days aggressive but achievable
   - Mitigation: Experienced team, clear scope, contingency buffer
