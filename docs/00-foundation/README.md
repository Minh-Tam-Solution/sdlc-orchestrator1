# Stage 00: Foundation (WHY?)
## Design Thinking + Business Validation

**Stage**: 00 - FOUNDATION

- Mode C Hybrid Fallback: Claude → Continue.dev auto-failover
- Investment committed: $124.5K for Q1-Q3 2026
- Revenue projection: +$34.5K ARR Year 1 from new epics

**Key Governance Lesson (Jan 2026)**:

🔴 **Irony Discovered**: We build a governance platform for AI+human teams, yet failed to govern our own architecture for 13 sprints.

**What Happened**: ADR-025 (unified frontend) was violated during Sprint 65-78. Team unknowingly recreated dual-frontend architecture despite Sprint 61-64 unification work.

**Root Cause**: Lack of ADR enforcement in sprint planning. No automated compliance checks.

**Corrective Actions**:
1. ✅ Re-unify frontend (Sprint 79 priority)
2. 🔄 Mandatory ADR review in G-Sprint-Open gate
3. 🤖 Automated ADR compliance checks (pre-commit hooks)
4. 🐶 Dogfood SDLC Orchestrator for our own development
5. 📚 ADR Active Summary for team onboarding

**Key Takeaway**: *"We cannot govern others if we cannot govern ourselves."* This incident led to mandatory ADR enforcement and automated compliance checks.

## Purpose

Stage 00 answers the fundamental question: **"WHY are we building this?"**

This stage combines:
- **Design Thinking** (EMPATHIZE → DEFINE → IDEATE) - Validate user problems
- **Traditional SDLC** - Business case, ROI, stakeholder alignment

**Critical Success Factor**: We must prove users have this problem BEFORE writing any code.

**3-Layer Architecture**:
```
Layer 3: AI Coders (Claude/Cursor/Copilot/OSS) ← We orchestrate
Layer 2: SDLC Orchestrator (Governance + Codegen) ← Our product
Layer 1: SDLC-Enterprise-Framework (Methodology) ← Our foundation
```
