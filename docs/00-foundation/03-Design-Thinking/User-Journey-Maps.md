## 🗺️ Journey Map 1: Engineering Manager (Feature Development)

### Journey Overview

**User**: Alex Chen, Engineering Manager (30-person SaaS)
**Goal**: Ship feature with >70% adoption (not <30% waste)
**Duration**: 4-8 weeks (idea → production)
**Stages**: 7 stages (Idea → Validation → Design → Build → Test → Deploy → Operate)

---

### Stage 1: Idea (Week 0)

**What Happens**:
- PM presents 5 feature ideas for next quarter
- Stakeholder meeting: CEO adds Feature X (HiPPO)
- EM reviews roadmap (knows 60-70% will fail)

**Current State (Without SDLC Orchestrator)**:

| Element | Current Experience |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Actions** | • Review Jira tickets<br>• Ask PM "Did you validate?"<br>• PM says "Yes" (no proof) |
| **Tools** | • Jira (no validation field)<br>• Slack (ad-hoc questions)<br>• Email (PM's notes scattered) |
| **Pain Points** | 🔴 No evidence of validation<br>🔴 Can't block un-validated features<br>🔴 CEO override (HiPPO) |
| **Emotions** | 😰 Anxious: "Here we go again, building wrong things"<br>😟 Helpless: "I can't say no to CEO" |
| **Time Spent** | 2 hours (reviewing roadmap, asking questions) |

**Desired State (With SDLC Orchestrator)**:

| Element | Improved Experience |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Actions** | • Open dashboard → Feature ideas<br>• Check Gate G0.1 status (🔴 5/5 features FAILED)<br>• PM must validate before sprint planning |
| **Tools** | • SDLC Orchestrator dashboard<br>• Evidence vault (no validation evidence yet) |
| **Gains** | ✅ Real-time validation status<br>✅ Can block CEO feature (policy enforcement)<br>✅ PM knows validation required |
| **Emotions** | 😌 Relieved: "System enforces validation, not me"<br>😊 Confident: "We'll build RIGHT things" |
| **Time Saved** | 1 hour (dashboard shows status instantly) |

**Opportunity**: Dashboard shows "0/5 features validated → Can't start sprint"

---

### Stage 2: Validation (Week 1-2)

**What Happens**:
- PM schedules 5 user interviews (Gate G0.1 requirement)
- Conducts interviews (45 min each)
- Synthesizes findings into problem statement

**Current State**:

| **Pain Points** | 🔴 Manual work (8 hours for 5 interviews)<br>🔴 Evidence lost (can't prove validation)<br>🔴 PM skips when busy |
| **Emotions** | 😫 Frustrated: "This takes too long"<br>😰 Worried: "I'll forget to save evidence" |
| **Time Spent** | 8 hours (5 interviews + synthesis) |

**Desired State**:

| Element | Improved Experience |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Actions** | • AI generates interview script<br>• PM uploads Zoom recording → Auto-transcribed<br>• Evidence auto-saved to vault |
| **Tools** | • SDLC Orchestrator (AI interview script)<br>• Evidence vault (auto-upload)<br>• Gate G0.1 (auto-check completeness) |
| **Gains** | ✅ AI script saves 2 hours<br>✅ Auto-transcription saves 3 hours<br>✅ Evidence searchable forever |
| **Emotions** | 😊 Happy: "This is actually easy"<br>😌 Confident: "Evidence is safe" |
| **Time Saved** | 5 hours (AI + automation) |

**Opportunity**: AI Interview Script Generator + Auto-Transcription + Evidence Vault

---

### Stage 3: PRD Writing (Week 2)

**What Happens**:
- PM synthesizes 5 interviews into PRD
- Writes problem statement, user personas, requirements, success metrics
- EM reviews PRD (2-3 revision cycles)

**Current State**:

| Element | Current Experience |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Actions** | • PM manually writes PRD (8-16 hours)<br>• Copy-pastes interview notes<br>• EM reviews → 3 revisions → 2 weeks total |
| **Tools** | • Google Docs (manual writing)<br>• Notion (interview notes)<br>• Email (review comments) |
| **Pain Points** | 🔴 Manual writing (8-16 hours)<br>🔴 Revision cycles (2-3 rounds)<br>🔴 Missing sections (no checklist) |

## 🎯 Key Insights from Journey Maps

### Critical Moments (Make-or-Break Points)

**Moment 1: Validation (Week 1-2)**
- **Current**: PM skips validation (too much manual work) → 70% waste
- **Opportunity**: AI script + auto-transcription → validation becomes easy → 100% compliance

**Moment 2: PRD Writing (Week 2)**
- **Current**: PM dreads 16-hour PRD writing → rushed quality → poor requirements
- **Opportunity**: AI generates 80% PRD → PM excited, not exhausted → better quality

**Moment 3: Launch (Week 7)**
- **Current**: Takes 7 days to know if feature failed → too late to fix
- **Opportunity**: 48-hour adoption score → early warning → fast iteration
