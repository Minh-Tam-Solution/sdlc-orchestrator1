## 🎯 Category 1: Validation (12 HMW Questions)

**Root Cause**: No validation gates → 60-70% feature waste

**POV**: Engineering Managers need to prevent building unwanted features

---

### HMW-V1: Core Validation
**How might we** help Engineering Managers validate features with 3+ users before sprint planning?

**Why important**: Gate G0.1 requires 3+ user validations
**Constraints**: <2 hours time investment (vs 80 hours wasted sprint)
**Ideas**: AI interview script, user recruitment service, validation checklist

---

### HMW-V2: Make Validation Easy
**How might we** make user validation so easy that PMs do it for every feature?

**Why important**: Survey shows only 15% validate currently
**Constraints**: Must be easier than skipping validation
**Ideas**: 1-click interview scheduler, AI question generator, automated transcription

---

### HMW-V3: Prove Validation
**How might we** help PMs prove they validated features (not just claim it)?

**Why important**: Engineers don't trust PM claims without evidence
**Constraints**: Evidence must be searchable, audit-ready
**Ideas**: Evidence vault, auto-save interviews, shareable validation reports

---

### HMW-V4: Prevent Un-Validated Features
**How might we** block engineering from starting sprints on un-validated features?

**Why important**: Enforcement is critical (process without enforcement fails)
**Constraints**: Must not frustrate developers
**Ideas**: GitHub PR check (gate status), Jira integration (block ticket), dashboard alert

---

### HMW-V5: Quantify Validation Quality
**How might we** help EMs measure validation quality (not just "yes/no did it")?

**Why important**: 1 softball interview ≠ 3 rigorous interviews
**Constraints**: Simple scoring (1-10 scale)
**Ideas**: AI validation score, peer review, EM approval required

---

### HMW-V6: Scale Validation Across Teams
**How might we** help CTOs ensure all 10 teams validate features consistently?

**Why important**: CTO needs standardization at scale
**Constraints**: Works for 50-500 engineers
**Ideas**: Org-wide dashboard, team benchmarking, validation leaderboard

---

### HMW-V7: Learn from Past Mistakes
**How might we** show EMs which un-validated features failed (learn from history)?

**Why important**: "Those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it"
**Constraints**: Non-blaming (learning, not punishment)
**Ideas**: Post-mortem dashboard, feature adoption tracking, pattern recognition

---

### HMW-V8: Validate Earlier
**How might we** help PMs validate features BEFORE detailed design (not after)?

**Why important**: Validating after design = sunk cost bias
**Constraints**: Gate G0.1 before Gate G1 (PRD)
**Ideas**: Problem validation phase, design thinking workshop, prototype testing

---

### HMW-V9: Validation Templates
**How might we** give PMs proven validation templates (not starting from scratch)?

### HMW-V11: Incentivize Users
**How might we** motivate users to participate in validation interviews?

**Why important**: Low response rates (20-30%)
**Constraints**: Budget ($50-100/interview)
**Ideas**: Gift cards, early access, feature voting, community recognition

---

### HMW-V12: Validation for B2B
**How might we** help B2B teams validate when users are busy executives?

**Why important**: ICP is Engineering Managers (busy, low availability)
**Constraints**: 15-30 min max interview time
**Ideas**: Async surveys, office hours, user advisory board

---

## 📂 Category 2: Evidence (10 HMW Questions)

**Root Cause**: No evidence trail → can't prove validation, audit chaos

**POV**: PMs need to prove validation, CTOs need audit-ready evidence

---

### HMW-E1: Auto-Collect Evidence
**How might we** automatically collect evidence without PM manual work?

**Why important**: Manual evidence collection fails (only 8% do it)
**Constraints**: Zero extra PM effort
**Ideas**: Browser extension (auto-screenshot), email integration, API uploads

---

### HMW-E2: Organize Evidence
**How might we** organize evidence so it's searchable and audit-ready?

**Constraints**: Git-like versioning
**Ideas**: Evidence history, diff view, rollback capability

---

### HMW-E7: Evidence Retention
**How might we** ensure evidence is retained for 2+ years (compliance requirement)?

**Why important**: SOC 2 requires 2-year evidence retention
**Constraints**: Storage cost (<$100/month for 100 teams)
**Ideas**: MinIO lifecycle policies, S3 glacier, compression

---

### HMW-E8: Evidence Security

**Constraints**: GDPR, CCPA compliance
**Ideas**: AES-256 encryption, IAM policies, audit logs

---

### HMW-E9: Evidence Templates
**How might we** give PMs evidence templates for common gates?

**Why important**: "What evidence does Gate G0.1 need?" → template shows
**Constraints**: Customizable per policy pack
**Ideas**: Template library, auto-fill forms, example evidence

---

### HMW-E10: Evidence Audit Trail
**How might we** show auditors WHO uploaded evidence WHEN?

**Why important**: Auditor asks "When was this validated?" → timestamp proves
