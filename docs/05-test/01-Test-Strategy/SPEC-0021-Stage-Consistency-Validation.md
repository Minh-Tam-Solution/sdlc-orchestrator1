# SPEC-0021: Stage Consistency Validation Service

## Executive Summary

### Purpose

This specification defines the **Stage Consistency Validation Service** - a systematic process to ensure consistency between Stage 01 (Specifications), Stage 02 (Design), Stage 03 (Integration), and Stage 04 (Implementation) throughout the software development lifecycle.

**Problem Statement**: Teams often maintain specifications, design documents, API contracts, and code in separate silos, leading to **drift** where code no longer matches design, or design no longer reflects specifications. This drift causes:
- Rework (discovered during testing)
- Communication gaps (team members working from different sources of truth)
- Technical debt (undocumented changes)
- Failed audits (evidence doesn't match reality)

**Solution**: Automated stage consistency validation with pre-implementation and post-implementation checklists, enforced through CI/CD gates.

### Key Features

1. **4-Stage Consistency Model**: Validates consistency across planning → design → integration → implementation
2. **Pre/Post Implementation Checklists**: Systematic validation before and after code changes
3. **Artifact Integrity Hashing**: SHA256 checksums to detect post-approval modifications
4. **SSOT Validation**: Single Source of Truth validation mechanism
5. **Tier-Specific Requirements**: Different validation depths for LITE/STANDARD/PROFESSIONAL/ENTERPRISE

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (Sprint 134) | Target (Sprint 135+) | Measurement |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Stage consistency violations | 182 violations | <10 violations | Evidence validator output |
| Documentation lag | Variable | 0 sprints >24h | Sprint Governance Rule 2 |
| Stage rollback rate | Unknown | <5% | Sprint governance metrics |
| Cross-stage conflicts | Manual detection | Automated CI/CD blocking | SSOT validator |

## 1. The 4-Stage Consistency Model

### 1.1 Stage Definitions

```yaml
Stage 01 (PLANNING):
  Purpose: WHAT - Define requirements and specifications
  Outputs:
    - Requirements documents
    - API specifications (OpenAPI 3.0)
    - User stories
  Gate: G1 (Legal + Market Validation)

Stage 02 (DESIGN):
  Purpose: HOW - Define architecture and design
  Outputs:
    - ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
    - System architecture diagrams
    - Database schema designs
  Gate: G2 (Design Ready)

Stage 03 (INTEGRATE):
  Purpose: CONTRACTS - Define integration points
  Outputs:
    - API contracts (OpenAPI validated)
    - Integration strategy documents
    - Third-party integration agreements
  Gate: G2 (parallel with Stage 02)

Stage 04 (BUILD):
  Purpose: CODE - Implement the design
  Outputs:
    - Source code
    - Unit tests
    - Code reviews
  Gate: G3 (Ship Ready)
```

### 1.2 Consistency Dependencies

```
Stage 01 ←→ Stage 02 ←→ Stage 03 ←→ Stage 04
   ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
  WHAT  →    HOW    →  CONTRACTS →   CODE
```

**Consistency Rules**:
1. **Stage 02 MUST reference Stage 01**: Every ADR must cite requirements from Stage 01
2. **Stage 03 MUST align with Stage 02**: API contracts must match architecture design
3. **Stage 04 MUST implement Stage 02/03**: Code must follow design and respect API contracts
4. **Backward updates required**: If Stage 04 requires design changes, Stage 02 ADRs MUST be updated

## 5. Artifact Integrity Hashing

### 5.1 Purpose

**Problem**: Documents can be modified after approval, creating "approved" documents that don't match what was actually approved.

**Solution**: SHA256 checksums recorded at gate approval time, verified before next stage.

### 5.2 Checksum Recording

```yaml
Checksum Recording Points:
  - G1 Pass: Record Stage 01 artifact checksums
  - G2 Pass: Record Stage 02 and Stage 03 artifact checksums
  - G3 Pass: Record Stage 04 artifact checksums

Artifacts to Hash:
  Stage 01:
    - Requirements documents
    - API specifications
    - User stories

  Stage 02:
    - ADRs (all)
    - Architecture diagrams (SVG/PNG)
    - Database schema files

  Stage 03:
    - API contracts (OpenAPI YAML/JSON)
    - Integration strategy documents

  Stage 04:
    - Git commit hash (for code)
    - Test coverage reports
    - Build artifacts
```

### 5.3 Checksum Storage

```json
{
  "$schema": "./artifact-checksums-schema.json",
  "project_id": "sdlc-orchestrator",
  "framework_version": "6.0.5",
  "recorded_at": "2026-02-01T10:00:00Z",

          "git_commit_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
          "note": "Code artifacts use Git commit hash instead of file checksums"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Checksum Verification

```bash
# Verify artifact integrity before Stage 04 implementation
sdlcctl verify-integrity \
  --checksums docs/artifact-checksums.json \
  --stage 01 \
  --stage 02 \
  --stage 03

# Expected output if NO modifications:
✅ Stage 01 artifacts: 12/12 VALID
✅ Stage 02 artifacts: 8/8 VALID
✅ Stage 03 artifacts: 3/3 VALID
✅ Overall integrity: VERIFIED

# Expected output if modifications detected:
❌ Stage 02 artifacts: 7/8 VALID
⚠️  Modified after approval:
    - docs/02-design/01-ADRs/ADR-005-API-Gateway.md
    Expected: ghi789jkl012...
    Actual:   xyz987uvw654...
    Modified: 2026-01-22T10:30:00Z (2 days after G2 approval)

❌ Overall integrity: FAILED
⚠️  Recommendation: Re-approve modified documents before proceeding
```

## 6. Common Inconsistency Patterns

### 6.1 Anti-Pattern: Code-First Development

**Description**: Developers write code without consulting design documents.

**Detection**:
```bash
sdlcctl detect-code-first \
  --code backend/app/ \
  --design docs/02-design/01-ADRs/ \
  --threshold 0.3

Output:
  ⚠️  Code-first development detected
  ⚠️  New patterns introduced: 5
  ⚠️  Matching ADRs: 0
  ⚠️  Recommendation: Create ADRs for new patterns before G3 gate
```

**Fix**:
1. Document new patterns in ADRs
2. Get design review approval
3. Re-run consistency validation

### 6.2 Anti-Pattern: Stale Specifications

**Description**: Stage 01 specifications not updated when requirements change.

**Detection**:
```bash
sdlcctl detect-stale-specs \
  --requirements docs/01-planning/03-Functional-Requirements/ \
  --code backend/app/ \
  --check-behavioral-changes

Output:
  ⚠️  Stale specifications detected
  ⚠️  Behavioral changes: 3
  ⚠️  Updated in Stage 01: 0
  ⚠️  Recommendation: Update requirements before G3 gate
```

**Fix**:
1. Update Stage 01 requirements documents
2. Record artifact checksums
3. Re-approve G1 gate (if major changes)

### 6.3 Anti-Pattern: API Drift

**Description**: Code API endpoints don't match Stage 03 contracts.

**Detection**:
```bash
sdlcctl detect-api-drift \
  --spec docs/03-integrate/01-api-contracts/openapi.yaml \
  --implementation backend/app/api/routes/

Output:
  ❌ API drift detected
  ❌ Mismatched endpoints: 3
      - GET /users/{id} (spec) vs GET /api/v1/users/{id} (code)
      - POST /projects (spec) vs POST /api/v1/workspaces (code)
  ❌ Missing endpoints: 2
      - DELETE /users/{id} (in spec, not in code)
  ❌ Recommendation: Update API contracts or fix implementation
```

**Fix**:
1. Update OpenAPI spec to match implementation
2. OR fix implementation to match spec
3. Get API contract review approval
4. Re-run G2 gate validation

## 9. Troubleshooting Guide

### 9.1 "Consistency validation failed: 25 violations"

**Symptom**: CI/CD blocks PR merge due to high violation count

**Root Causes**:
1. Documentation not updated after code changes
2. New patterns introduced without ADRs
3. API contracts outdated

**Fix**:
```bash
# 1. Generate detailed violation report
sdlcctl report-consistency \
  --input consistency-report.json \
  --format detailed

# 2. Group violations by type
sdlcctl analyze-violations \
  --input consistency-report.json \
  --group-by type

# 3. Fix most common violations first
#    Example: "Missing ADRs for new patterns"
sdlcctl generate-adr \
  --pattern new_authentication_flow \
  --output docs/02-design/01-ADRs/ADR-NEW-Auth-Flow.md

# 4. Re-run validation
sdlcctl validate-consistency \
  --stage 01 docs/01-planning/ \
  --stage 02 docs/02-design/ \
  --stage 03 docs/03-integrate/ \
  --stage 04 backend/app/ \
  --output consistency-report.json

# 5. Verify violations reduced
jq '.violations | length' consistency-report.json
```

### 9.2 "Artifact integrity check failed"

**Symptom**: Stage 02 ADR modified after G2 approval

**Root Cause**: Document edited after gate approval without re-approval

**Fix**:
```bash
# 1. Identify modified artifacts
sdlcctl verify-integrity \
  --checksums docs/artifact-checksums.json \
  --stage 02 \
  --verbose

# 2. Review changes
git diff <approval_commit> docs/02-design/01-ADRs/ADR-005.md

# 3. If changes are valid:
#    a. Get re-approval from design review board
#    b. Update checksums
sdlcctl update-checksums \
  --stage 02 \
  --output docs/artifact-checksums.json

# 4. If changes are accidental:
#    a. Revert to approved version
git checkout <approval_commit> -- docs/02-design/01-ADRs/ADR-005.md

# 5. Re-run integrity check
sdlcctl verify-integrity \
  --checksums docs/artifact-checksums.json \
  --stage 02
```

### 9.3 "SSOT validation failed: conflicting sprint numbers"

**Symptom**: Different documents reference different sprint numbers

**Root Cause**: Sprint numbering updated in some documents but not all

**Fix**:
```bash
# 1. Run SSOT validation (from Sprint Governance Rule 6)
tools/validate-sprint-consistency.sh docs/

# 2. Review conflicts
#    Example output:
#    ❌ CURRENT-SPRINT.md: Sprint 135
#    ❌ ROADMAP.md: Sprint 134
#    ❌ PROJECT-PLAN.md: Sprint 136

# 3. Determine correct sprint number
#    (usually CURRENT-SPRINT.md is source of truth)

# 4. Update all conflicting documents
#    Use search-and-replace
