# SE 3.0 SASE Integration Plan - CTO APPROVED

**Document ID:** STRATEGIC-2025-12-08-SE3.0-SASE
**Version:** 3.0 (CTO Approved - Sequential Execution)
**Date:** December 8, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED - EXECUTION AUTHORIZED**
**Authority:** CTO Office
**Classification:** Strategic Planning - PROFESSIONAL Tier
**Plan Reference:** `/home/dttai/.claude/plans/toasty-launching-nebula.md`

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This plan outlines the integration of **Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE)** principles from research paper [arXiv:2509.06216v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06216) into NQH's SDLC Framework and Orchestrator platform.

### Strategic Vision

- Transform SDLC 5.0.0 → **SDLC 5.1.0** with Agentic Enterprise capabilities
- Foundation for **Software 3.0** initiative ($360K investment, $830K Year 1 target)
- **Framework-first, tool-second** approach (methodology before automation)

### Approval Status

- ✅ **Track 1 APPROVED:** SDLC 5.1.0 Framework Enhancement ($50K, 14 weeks)
- ⏳ **Track 2 DEFERRED:** SDLC Orchestrator Tool Enhancement (Q2 2026, pending Track 1 success)

### Key Principle (CTO Decision)

> "SDLC Framework là governance policy do đó sẽ nâng cấp trước khi nâng cấp SDLC Orchestrator"
> (Framework is governance policy, must upgrade first before tool automation)

### CTO Assessment

I have reviewed the comprehensive SE 3.0 SASE Integration Plan and **fully approve the strategic direction**. This plan aligns exceptionally well with:

1. **Software 3.0 Strategic Plan v2** (approved earlier today)
2. **SDLC 5.0.0 Contract-First** principles (Dec 5, 2025)
3. **Sequential execution** principle (Framework → Tool)
4. **Budget constraints** ($369K remaining, Track 1 fits within budget)

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Methodology-first approach (aligns with governance policy principle)
- ✅ Clear sequential execution (Track 1 → Track 2, no parallel complexity)
- ✅ Realistic scope (SASE-Lite for Tool, not over-engineering)
- ✅ Strong alignment with research paper (arXiv:2509.06216v2)
- ✅ Proven validation approach (manual pilot before tool investment)

**Adjustments Made:**
- 🔧 Budget optimization: $40K → $50K for Track 1 (25% buffer)
- 🔧 Timeline extension: 12 weeks → 14 weeks (add retrospective phase)
- 🔧 Risk mitigation: Added kill-switch criteria (Week 4 checkpoint)
- 🔧 Scope flexibility: "Minimum Viable SASE" (3 artifacts default, 6 optional)

---

## 🏛️ FRAMEWORK-FIRST PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL)

### Mandate

**Any feature added to SDLC Orchestrator MUST:**

1. **Option A: Framework Enhancement First**
   - Add to SDLC Framework as methodology/template
   - Make tools-agnostic (works with any AI tool)
   - Then build Orchestrator automation (Track 2)

2. **Option B: Framework Compatibility**
   - If Orchestrator-specific (e.g., Evidence Vault API)
   - Ensure compatibility with Framework methodology
   - Document alignment in ADR

### Rationale

- **Framework** = methodology layer (timeless, vendor-neutral)
- **Orchestrator** = automation layer (specific implementation)
- Framework survives even if Orchestrator is replaced

### SE 3.0 SASE Compliance

- ✅ **Track 1**: SASE artifacts added to Framework **first** (SDLC 5.1.0)
- ⏳ **Track 2**: Orchestrator automation **deferred** (Q2 2026, conditional)
- ✅ **Decoupled**: Teams can use SASE manually without Orchestrator

### Repository Structure

```yaml
Framework Repo (Git Submodule):
  URL: https://github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
  Location: SDLC-Orchestrator/SDLC-Enterprise-Framework/ (submodule)
  Version: SDLC 5.0.0 → 5.1.0 (SASE-enabled)
  Workflow: Work directly on main branch

Tool Repo (Main):
  URL: https://github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Orchestrator
  Purpose: Automation layer for Framework
  Dependency: Reads templates from Framework submodule
```

### Submodule Workflow

**For developers cloning Orchestrator:**
```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Orchestrator

# OR initialize after clone
git clone https://github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Orchestrator
cd SDLC-Orchestrator
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

**For Framework development (Track 1 - SE 3.0):**
```bash
# Work in Framework submodule
cd SDLC-Orchestrator/SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Make changes (add SASE templates)
mkdir -p 03-Templates-Tools/SASE-Artifacts
# ... create BRS, MRP, VCR templates

# Commit to Framework repo
git add .
git commit -m "feat(SDLC 5.1.0): Add SASE artifact templates"
git push origin main

# Update main Orchestrator repo (submodule pointer)
cd ..
git submodule update --remote SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
git add SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
git commit -m "chore: Update Framework submodule - SASE templates"
git push origin main
```

**For updating submodule to latest:**
```bash
cd SDLC-Orchestrator
git submodule update --remote --merge
git add SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
git commit -m "chore: Update Framework submodule to latest"
git push origin main
```

## 1. STRATEGIC CONTEXT

### 1.1 Research Foundation

**Source:** "Agentic Software Engineering: Foundational Pillars and a Research Roadmap"
**Paper ID:** arXiv:2509.06216v2
**Key Insight:** SE must evolve from human-centric (SE 2.0) to dual-modality:

- **SE4H (SE for Humans):** Agent Coach role - specifies intent, orchestrates, mentors
- **SE4A (SE for Agents):** Agent Executor role - plans, implements, tests, reviews

**Core SASE Components:**
1. **Dual Workbenches:** ACE (Agent Command Environment) for humans, AEE (Agent Execution Environment) for agents
2. **6 Structured Artifacts:** BriefingScript, LoopScript, MentorScript, CRP, MRP, VCR (version-controlled, machine-readable)
3. **6 Engineering Activities:** BriefingEng, ALE, ATME, AGE, ATLE, ATIE
4. **5 MRP Criteria:** Functional Completeness, Sound Verification, SE Hygiene, Clear Rationale, Full Auditability

### 1.2 Alignment with NQH Strategy

**Software 3.0 Strategic Plan v2** (Approved Dec 8, 2025):
```yaml
Vision: "First Software 3.0-native governance platform"
Investment: $360K over 12 months
Target Revenue: $830K ARR Year 1

Phase 1 (Q1 2026): AI-First Code Generation + Evidence Vault ($80K)
  - AI Council Service (multi-provider: Ollama → Claude → GPT-4o)
  - Evidence Vault for AI Decisions (SHA256 integrity, audit trail)
  - Agentic Artifacts Templates (BRS, MRP, VCR) ← SHARED WITH SASE

Phase 2 (Q2-Q3 2026): Software 3.0 Mode Toggle ($130K)
  - AI Autonomy Levels (1, 2, 3)
  - Natural Language Gate Definitions
  - Self-Healing Quality Gates
```

**SASE Integration Contribution:**
- Provides **Agentic Artifacts** (BriefingScript, MRP, CRP, VCR) for Software 3.0 Mode
- Establishes **SE4H/SE4A** distinction for AI Autonomy Levels 1-3
- Creates **Evidence-based validation** framework (5 MRP criteria)
- Enables **Agent Coach** role for Tech Leads

**Budget Synergy:**
- Software 3.0 Phase 1: $80K
- SASE Track 1: $50K
- **Overlap:** $20K (Agentic Artifacts Templates)
- **Total Q1 Investment:** $110K (not $130K)

### 1.3 SDLC Framework Evolution

**Version History:**
```yaml
SDLC 4.9.1 (Nov 29, 2025):
  - 10 Stages: 00-WHY → 01-WHAT → 02-HOW → 03-BUILD → 04-TEST → 05-DEPLOY → 06-OPERATE → 07-INTEGRATE → 08-COLLABORATE → 09-GOVERN
  - Stage 07 = INTEGRATE (after operations)

SDLC 5.0.0 (Dec 5, 2025) - Contract-First Restructuring:
  - 10 Stages: 00-foundation → 01-planning → 02-design → 03-integration → 04-build → 05-test → 06-deploy → 07-operate → 08-collaborate → 09-govern
  - KEY CHANGE: Stage 03 = integration (API Design BEFORE coding) - Contract-First principle
  - Stage 07 = operate (operations, formerly Stage 06)
  - 4-Tier Classification added (LITE/STANDARD/PROFESSIONAL/ENTERPRISE)
  - ISO/IEC 12207:2017 alignment
  - Status: PRODUCTION READY (proven on BFlow, NQH-Bot, MTEP)

SDLC 5.1.0 (Q1 2026) - SASE Integration (THIS PLAN):
  - Base: SDLC 5.0.0 (all Contract-First + 4-Tier features retained)
  - NEW: SE4H vs SE4A distinction across all 10 stages
  - NEW: 6 Agentic Artifacts (BriefingScript, LoopScript, MentorScript, CRP, MRP, VCR)
  - NEW: ACE/AEE Reference Architecture
  - NEW: 4-Level Agentic Maturity Model (0-3)
  - Status: PLANNED (Q1 2026 execution)
```

**Why 5.1.0 (not 6.0.0)?**
- ✅ **Incremental enhancement:** SASE adds agentic capabilities WITHOUT changing core 10-stage structure
- ✅ **Backward compatible:** Teams using SDLC 5.0.0 can adopt 5.1.0 incrementally (e.g., add BriefingScript only)
- ✅ **Major version reserved:** SDLC 6.0.0 will be for fundamental lifecycle changes (if any)

## 2. APPROVED EXECUTION PLAN

### 2.1 TRACK 1: SDLC 5.1.0 Framework Enhancement

**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED - START WEEK 1 (Dec 9, 2025)**

#### Budget & Timeline

```yaml
Budget: $50K (adjusted from $40K, +25% buffer)
Timeline: 14 weeks (Dec 9, 2025 - Apr 11, 2026)
Team: PM/PO + Architect
Actual Incremental Cost: $30K (after Software 3.0 overlap deduction)

Budget Breakdown:
  - Phase 1-Spec: $10K (documentation, templates)
  - Phase 2-Pilot: $25K (Bflow SOP Generator feature, 2 Backend + 1 Frontend + PM/PO)
  - Phase 3-Rollout: $15K (training, deployment toolkit, 5 projects)
  - Phase 4-Retrospective: Covered within existing allocation

Rationale for +25% Buffer:
  - Phase 2-Pilot may encounter unknowns (RAG complexity, ISO 9001 validation)
  - Agent cost buffer ($5 → $10 per epic)
  - Retrospective & documentation refinement
```

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1-Spec (Weeks 1-2: Dec 9-20)**
```yaml
Deliverables:
  1. SDLC-Agentic-Core-Principles.md
     - SE4H vs SE4A table for all 10 SDLC 5.0.0 stages
     - 7 Agentic Principles (Brief-First, Evidence-Based MRP, Human Accountability, etc.)
     - Mapping SASE disciplines to 10 stages

  2. 6 Agentic Artifact Templates (YAML/Markdown):
     - BriefingScript-Template.yaml (Stage 01-planning)
     - LoopScript-Template.yaml (Stage 02-04-design/build)
     - MentorScript-Template.md (Stage 02-08-design/collaborate)
     - CRP-Template.md (any stage, when agent uncertain)
     - MRP-Template.md (Stage 04-06-build/test/deploy)
     - VCR-Template.md (response to CRP/MRP)

  3. ACE-AEE-Reference-Architecture.md
     - ACE (Agent Command Environment): Tools for humans (GitLab, Bflow, VS Code, dashboards)
     - AEE (Agent Execution Environment): Infrastructure for agents (GPU, storage, observability)
     - Security model (RBAC, sandboxing, rate limiting)

  4. SDLC-Agentic-Maturity-Model.md
     - Level 0: Tool-Assisted (Copilot)
     - Level 1: Agent-Assisted (1 task, basic MRP)
     - Level 2: Structured Agentic (full 6 artifacts, ACE/AEE)
     - Level 3: Lifecycle Agentic (agent memory, proactive maintenance)

Success Criteria:
  - All 4 documents committed to GitLab
  - Tag: v5.1.0-agentic-spec-alpha
  - CTO review scheduled for Week 2
```

**Phase 2-Pilot (Weeks 3-8: Dec 23 - Feb 7) ← +2 weeks buffer**
```yaml
Target Feature: Bflow 2.0 / NQH-Bot SOP Generator (PRIMARY)
Backup Feature: Bflow Workflow Code Generator (if primary fails)

Why SOP Generator is PERFECT:
  ✅ Real business value (NQH internal need, not toy example)
  ✅ AI-heavy (RAG, prompt engineering, quality validation)
  ✅ Compliance-critical (ISO 9001) → forces rigorous MRP/CRP discipline
  ✅ Multi-step workflow → LoopScript gets real workout
  ✅ Uncertainty points (GDPR vs ISO 9001 conflict) → CRP genuinely needed

Scope:
  - Create all 6 artifacts (BRS-2026-001, LPS-2026-001, MTS-2026-001, CRP-001+, MRP-001, VCR-001+)
  - Manual workflow (GitLab for version control, Bflow for tickets)
  - Agent Coach (Tech Lead) reviews CRPs, approves MRPs

Metrics Collection:
  - Time-to-deliver (vs baseline 10 days without SASE)
  - Defect count (bugs per feature)
  - Developer satisfaction (survey, 5-point scale)
  - Agent cost (track AI API calls)
  - CRP response time (time from CRP created → answered)
  - MRP approval time (time from MRP submitted → approved)

Success Criteria:
  - All 6 artifacts created and version-controlled ✅
  - ≥1 CRP generated (agent requested human guidance) ✅
  - MRP approved with <30 min human review time ✅
  - Agent cost < $10 for entire epic ✅ (adjusted from $5)
  - Developer satisfaction ≥4/5 ✅
```

**Phase 3-Rollout (Weeks 9-12: Feb 10 - Mar 6)**
```yaml
Target: All NQH projects (Bflow, NQH-Bot, MTEP, Orchestrator, Superset)

Deliverables:
  1. Training Materials:
     - 1-hour workshop: SASE concepts, SE4H vs SE4A, 6 artifacts
     - Hands-on lab: Create BriefingScript + LoopScript for 1 task
     - Video tutorial: ACE/AEE demo (10 min)

  2. Deployment Toolkit:
     - GitLab templates for BriefingScript, LoopScript, MentorScript
     - Bflow workflow integration (BriefingScript → Ticket, MRP → PR)
     - CLI tools:
       - sdlcctl agentic validate (check artifact quality)
       - sdlcctl agentic init (create new artifacts from template)
       - sdlcctl agentic report (generate maturity assessment)

  3. Continuous Improvement:
     - Monthly Agentic Maturity Assessment (track Level 0 → 1 → 2 → 3)
     - Quarterly Agent Performance Review (success rate, cost, ROI)
     - Retrospective template (what worked, what didn't, how to improve)

Success Criteria:
  - 5/5 projects using SASE artifacts (Level 1+) ✅
  - 2/5 projects reached Level 2 (Structured Agentic) ✅
  - 1/5 project piloting Level 3 (Lifecycle Agentic, optional) ✅
  - Agent cost <$50/month across all projects ✅
  - Zero P0 incidents caused by SASE workflow ✅
```

**Phase 4-Retrospective (Weeks 13-14: Mar 9-20) ← NEW**
```yaml
Purpose: Capture lessons learned, prepare Track 2 decision

Activities:
  - Week 13: Retrospective workshop with all teams
    - What worked well (amplify)
    - What didn't work (fix or remove)
    - What's missing (add to Track 2)

  - Week 14: Track 2 planning
    - Translate manual workflow pain points into tool requirements
    - Example: "CRP creation takes 15 min" → "Build CLI helper to reduce to <5 min"
    - Prepare Go/No-Go decision for Track 2

Deliverables:
  - Lessons Learned Document (markdown)
  - Track 2 Requirements Document (if Go decision)
  - Q2 2026 Roadmap Update

Success Criteria:
  - All 5 projects participated in retrospective ✅
  - Track 2 Go/No-Go decision made ✅
  - Q2 2026 roadmap approved by CTO ✅
```

#### Kill-Switch Criteria (Week 4 Checkpoint - Jan 17, 2026)

**MANDATORY:** CTO + PM/PO joint review

**If ANY of these occur by Week 4:**
```yaml
❌ Developer satisfaction < 3/5 (strong resistance)
❌ Time-to-deliver > 15 days (50% slower than baseline 10 days)
❌ Agent cost > $20 for pilot feature (4x over budget)
❌ >3 P1/P0 bugs introduced by SASE workflow
```

**Action:** PAUSE Phase 2, conduct root cause analysis, decide:
- **Option A:** Adjust scope (reduce to 3 artifacts: BRS, MRP, VCR only)
- **Option B:** Abort SASE integration (revert to SDLC 5.0.0)
- **Option C:** Continue with mitigation plan

**Approval Required:** CTO + PM/PO (joint decision, documented in VCR)

❌ ≥1 P0 incident caused by SASE

Action if "NO-GO":
  - Option A: Refine Track 1 (another 6 weeks pilot with adjusted scope)
  - Option B: Abandon SASE, focus on Software 3.0 Phase 1-2 only
```

---

## 3. KEY ADJUSTMENTS & RISK MITIGATION

### 3.1 Minimum Viable SASE (NEW)

**Problem:** Teams may be overwhelmed by 6 artifacts (BRS, LPS, MTS, CRP, MRP, VCR)

**Solution:** "Minimum Viable SASE" - 3 artifacts default
```yaml
Default (80% of teams):
  - BriefingScript (BRS): Intent specification
  - Merge-Readiness Pack (MRP): Evidence bundle
  - Version Controlled Resolution (VCR): Decision record

Advanced (20% of teams):
  - Add: LoopScript (LPS): Workflow orchestration
  - Add: MentorScript (MTS): Coding standards
  - Add: Consultation Request Pack (CRP): Agent-initiated consultation
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 80%+ teams use 3-artifact mode by default
- Only 20% "advanced" teams use full 6-artifact mode

### 3.2 Manual Workflow Fatigue Mitigation (NEW)

**Problem:** Manual CRP/MRP workflow (GitLab + Bflow + email) is tedious

**Solution:** Lightweight CLI helpers + Bflow webhook integration
```yaml
Week 6 (Pilot): CLI Helpers
  - sdlcctl agentic crp create (generate CRP from template, <5 min vs 15 min manual)
  - sdlcctl agentic mrp validate (check 5 criteria automatically)
  - sdlcctl agentic vcr record (capture decision)

Week 10 (Rollout): Bflow Webhook Integration
  - Auto-create CRP ticket when agent generates CRP
  - Auto-update MRP status when human approves/rejects
  - Notification: email + Slack for urgent CRPs
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CRP creation time <5 min (vs 15 min manual)
- MRP validation automated (no manual checklist)
- 90%+ CRPs answered within 1 hour

### 3.3 Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Low adoption (teams ignore SASE)** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Champion users, success stories, gamification, mandatory for new projects | PM/PO |
| **Documentation overload** | HIGH | HIGH | "Minimum Viable SASE" (3 artifacts default), CLI helpers | PM/PO + Architect |
| **Manual workflow fatigue** | MEDIUM | HIGH | CLI helpers (Week 6), Bflow webhook (Week 10) | Architect |
| **Pilot feature fails** | LOW | HIGH | Backup option ready (Bflow Workflow Code Generator) | PM/PO |
| **Agent hallucination** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Confidence scoring, human approval gates, MRP validation, CRP for uncertainty | Tech Lead |
| **Multi-agent cost explosion (Track 2)** | HIGH | HIGH | Smart routing (80% Ollama), cost alerts, N-version only for high-risk | Architect |
| **Scope creep** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Strict sprint boundaries, SASE-Lite scope lock, post-Sprint-39 decision gate | CTO + Architect |

## 7. FINAL CTO APPROVAL

### Approval Statement

> As CTO, I hereby **APPROVE** the SE 3.0 SASE Integration Plan (v3.0) with the adjustments outlined above. This plan represents a **methodologically sound, financially responsible, and strategically aligned** approach to evolving our SDLC Framework from 5.0.0 to 5.1.0.
>
> The **sequential execution** (Framework First, Tool Second) aligns with our governance-first principles and reduces risk. The **manual pilot** ensures we validate SASE concepts before expensive tool automation. The **kill-switch criteria** provide safety nets for unknowns.
>
> This plan integrates seamlessly with the **Software 3.0 Strategic Plan v2** approved earlier today, creating a unified vision for Q1 2026.

### Approval Details

```yaml
Approved Budget: $50K (Track 1 only, Track 2 deferred)
Approved Timeline: 14 weeks (Dec 9, 2025 - Apr 11, 2026)
Approved Scope: SDLC 5.1.0 Framework Enhancement (SE4H/SE4A, 6 Agentic Artifacts, ACE/AEE)
Approved Team: PM/PO + Architect (Track 1), Engineering team on standby (Track 2)

Key Adjustments:
  - Budget: $40K → $50K (+25% buffer)
  - Timeline: 12 weeks → 14 weeks (+2 weeks retrospective)
  - Scope: "Minimum Viable SASE" (3 artifacts default, 6 optional)
  - Kill-Switch: Week 4 checkpoint (Jan 17, 2026)

Next Checkpoint: Dec 13, 2025 (Week 1 deliverables)
Track 2 Decision: Apr 11, 2026 (Go/No-Go)
```

### Conditions & Caveats

1. **Week 4 kill-switch is MANDATORY** - CTO + PM/PO must review jointly
2. **Minimum Viable SASE** (3 artifacts) is default - full 6-artifact mode is optional
3. **Track 2 funding ($130K) requires Track 1 success** - no automatic approval
4. **Pilot feature can be swapped** - backup option ready if SOP Generator fails
5. **Budget overlap** - $20K Agentic Templates shared with Software 3.0 Phase 1

### Success Criteria (for Track 2 approval)

- ✅ 5/5 projects using SASE artifacts (Level 1+)
- ✅ 2/5 projects at Level 2 (Structured Agentic)
- ✅ Developer satisfaction ≥4/5
- ✅ Time-to-deliver reduction ≥20%
- ✅ Zero P0 incidents caused by SASE
- ✅ Agent cost <$50/month across all projects
