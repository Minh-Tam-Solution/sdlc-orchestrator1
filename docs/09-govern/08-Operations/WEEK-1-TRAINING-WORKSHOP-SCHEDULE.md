# Verify Docker installed (for testing)
docker --version
# Required: Docker 20.10+

# Verify network access
ping github.com
# Required: Internet connectivity to clone repos
```

**Lab Repositories:**
```bash
# Main repo (with submodule)
https://github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Orchestrator

# Framework repo (submodule)

```

---

### **Lab 1: Clone and Verify (5 min)**

**Objective:** Clone SDLC Orchestrator with Framework submodule

**Instructions:**
```bash
# Step 1: Clone with submodule (choose ONE method)

# Method A: Single command (recommended)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Orchestrator
cd SDLC-Orchestrator

# Method B: Two commands (alternative)
git clone https://github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Orchestrator
cd SDLC-Orchestrator
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Step 2: Verify submodule status
git submodule status
# Expected output: Shows Framework commit hash + path

# Step 3: Count Framework directories
ls -1 SDLC-Enterprise-Framework/ | wc -l
# Expected: 10+ directories (00-Why, 01-What, etc.)

# Step 4: Verify Framework remote
cd SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
git remote -v
# Expected: github.com/Minh-Tam-Solution/SDLC-Enterprise-Framework
```
