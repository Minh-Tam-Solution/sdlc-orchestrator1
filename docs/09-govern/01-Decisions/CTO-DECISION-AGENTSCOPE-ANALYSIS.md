# CTO Decision Summary: AgentScope Integration Analysis

**Date**: December 28, 2025  
**Decision Maker**: CTO  
**Subject**: AgentScope Integration Feasibility Study  
**Verdict**: 🔴 **DO NOT INTEGRATE - EXTRACT PATTERNS ONLY**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of AgentScope (Alibaba's 14.6k⭐ agent framework), the CTO has decided to **REJECT runtime integration** and instead adopt an **"Inspired Evolution"** strategy.

### Key Finding

**SDLC Orchestrator already has multi-agent architecture equivalent to AgentScope!**

Our `AICouncilService` (1,550+ LOC) implements 3-stage multi-agent deliberation functionally identical to AgentScope's `MsgHub`.

---

## 🎯 Decision

### ✅ APPROVED ACTIONS

1. **Study AgentScope source code** for architectural patterns
2. **Extract ReAct, Memory, Tool patterns** for learning
3. **Implement patterns in AICouncilService** (Sprint 65-68)
4. **Quarterly review** of AgentScope development

### ❌ PROHIBITED ACTIONS

1. Add `agentscope` as pip dependency
2. Replace `AICouncilService` with AgentScope agents
3. Market product as "powered by AgentScope"
4. Introduce new external runtime dependencies

## 📈 Alignment Score

| Category | Weight | Score | Weighted |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Architecture Fit | 30% | 5/10 | 1.5 |
| Cost Efficiency | 25% | 3/10 | 0.75 |
| Risk Assessment | 20% | 6/10 | 1.2 |
| Strategic Value | 25% | 5/10 | 1.25 |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | **4.7/10** | **47%** |

**Adjusted Score**: 50/100 (initial estimate was 70/100)

---

## 🚫 Why NOT to Integrate

### 1. Redundancy
**Impact**: HIGH  
`AICouncilService` (1,550+ LOC) already implements equivalent architecture:
- Stage 1: Parallel Queries = AgentScope parallel execution
- Stage 2: Peer Review = AgentScope collaboration
- Stage 3: Synthesis = AgentScope aggregation

### 2. Cost Already Optimized
**Impact**: HIGH  
Current provider chain saves **$11,400/year** (95% reduction):
- Ollama ($50/mo) → Claude ($1000/mo) → GPT-4 ($800/mo) → Rules
- AgentScope **CANNOT** improve this!

### 3. License Risk
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
Unclear AGPL contamination risk from Alibaba SDK dependencies.

### 4. Training Overhead
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
6-8 weeks effort + team training not justified for minimal benefit.

### 5. Loss of Control
**Impact**: HIGH  
Full ownership of existing codebase vs. external framework dependency.

## 🔍 Gap Analysis

### Closed Gaps (We Lead)

✅ Multi-agent messaging  
✅ Provider abstraction  
✅ Async execution  
✅ **Fallback chain** (automatic, AgentScope is manual)  
✅ **Cost tracking** (AgentScope has none)  
✅ **Quality gates** (4-stage pipeline, AgentScope has none)

### Open Gaps (Worth Learning From)

🔴 **ReAct planning** - AgentScope has built-in reasoning-action loops  
🔴 **Long-term memory** - AgentScope has ReMe (Retrieval-enhanced Memory)  
🔴 **Tool orchestration** - AgentScope has parallel tool execution  
🟡 **Visualization** - AgentScope Studio vs. our Grafana dashboards

## 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap: "Inspired Evolution"

> **Update (Jan 03, 2026)**: Sprint 61-64 is allocated to frontend platform consolidation (Next.js) per ADR-025.
> This AI Council roadmap is rescheduled to **Sprint 65-68**.

### Sprint 65: Research Phase (2 weeks)
- Deep-dive AgentScope source code
- Extract ReAct implementation pattern
- Design memory enhancement schema
- Document patterns for team

### Sprint 66: ReAct Enhancement (2 weeks)
- Add ReAct loop to `AICouncilService` Stage 1
- Implement reasoning chain tracking
- Add plan generation capability
- Unit tests for ReAct logic

### Sprint 67: Memory Enhancement (2 weeks)
- Design agent memory schema
- Implement memory retrieval (Redis + pgvector)
- Add context window optimization

### Sprint 68: Tool Orchestration (2 weeks)
- Parallel tool execution patterns
- Timeouts, cancellation, result aggregation
- Integration points with existing codegen/tooling
- Migration for existing projects

### Sprint 68: Tool Orchestration (2 weeks)
- Add parallel tool executor
- Implement tool interruption
- Add tool result aggregation
- Integration with EP-06 codegen

**Total Effort**: 8 weeks across 4 sprints  
**Cost**: ~$20/mo (OpenAI embeddings only)  
**Risk**: LOW (incremental, no external dependencies)

## 💰 Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Option A: Integrate AgentScope Runtime
- **Cost**: $0 (Apache 2.0 license)
- **Effort**: 6-8 weeks full replacement
- **Risk**: HIGH (license, team training, loss of control)
- **Benefit**: Minimal (already have equivalent architecture)
- **Verdict**: ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**

### Option B: Inspired Evolution (Pattern Extraction)
- **Cost**: ~$20/mo (embeddings)
- **Effort**: 8 weeks incremental enhancement
- **Risk**: LOW (no external dependencies)
- **Benefit**: HIGH (learn best practices, maintain control)
- **Verdict**: ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

## 📋 Governance & Review

### Official Guardrails

**AgentScope Policy**:
```
DECISION: DO NOT INTEGRATE AGENTSCOPE RUNTIME

APPROVED ACTIONS:
✅ Study source code for patterns
✅ Extract ReAct, Memory, Tool patterns
✅ Implement in AICouncilService (Sprint 65-68)

PROHIBITED ACTIONS:
❌ Add as pip dependency
❌ Replace AICouncilService
❌ Market as "powered by AgentScope"

REVIEW GATE: Q2 2026
```

### Review Gate: Q2 2026

Reassess AgentScope integration if:
- Custom ReAct/Memory implementation proves insufficient
- Enterprise customer explicitly requests AgentScope
- AGPL assessment completed and deemed safe
- AgentScope adds critical enterprise features
