**Analogy**:
- **SDLC-Enterprise-Framework** is like **Scrum** (methodology) or **ITIL** (framework)
- **SDLC Orchestrator** is like **Jira** (tool that helps teams follow Scrum)

Teams can follow SDLC-Enterprise-Framework manually with spreadsheets and any tools. SDLC Orchestrator makes it 10x easier by automating enforcement, collecting evidence, and providing AI assistance.

### Stage Details

| Stage | Name | Core Question | Key Deliverables | Gate |
|-------|------|---------------|------------------|------|
| **00** | FOUNDATION | WHY are we building this? | Business Case, Problem Statement, Personas | G0.1, G0.2 |
| **01** | PLANNING | WHAT are we building? | Requirements, User Stories, API Specs | G1 |
| **02** | DESIGN | HOW will we build it? | Architecture, ADRs, Security Design | G2 |
| **03** | INTEGRATE | How does it connect? | API Contracts, Integration Tests | - |
| **04** | BUILD | Are we building it right? | Working Code, Unit Tests | G3 |
| **05** | TEST | Does it work correctly? | Test Reports, UAT Sign-off | G3 |
| **06** | DEPLOY | How do we ship safely? | Release Notes, Rollback Procedures | G4 |
| **07** | OPERATE | Is it running reliably? | Runbooks, Monitoring Dashboards | G4 |
| **08** | COLLABORATE | Is the team effective? | Team Charter, Training Materials | - |
| **09** | GOVERN | Are we compliant? | Compliance Reports, Audit Docs | - |

### Why 10 Stages (Not 4)?

Traditional CI/CD focuses on 4 stages: Build → Test → Deploy → Operate

**SDLC 5.1.1 adds 6 critical stages**:

| Added Stage | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **00 FOUNDATION** | Validates WHY before building → prevents 60-70% feature waste |
| **01 PLANNING** | Defines WHAT precisely → reduces scope creep |
| **02 DESIGN** | Plans HOW systematically → prevents architecture debt |
| **03 INTEGRATE** | Manages dependencies early → prevents integration hell |
| **08 COLLABORATE** | Ensures team effectiveness → prevents knowledge silos |
| **09 GOVERN** | Maintains compliance → prevents audit chaos |

---

## 3. 4-Tier Classification System

Not all projects need the same rigor. SDLC 5.1.1 scales with team size:

| Tier | Team Size | Required Stages | Documentation Level | Example |
|------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| **LITE** | 1-2 | 00, 01, 02, 04 | README + .env.example | Side project, MVP |
| **STANDARD** | 3-10 | 00-02, 04-06 | + CLAUDE.md + /docs | Startup, small team |
| **PROFESSIONAL** | 10-50 | All 10 stages | + Full ADRs + Compliance | Scale-up, enterprise team |
| **ENTERPRISE** | 50+ | All 10 stages | + Executive Reports + Audit | Large organization |

### SDLC Orchestrator Uses PROFESSIONAL Tier

SDLC Orchestrator itself follows the PROFESSIONAL tier:
- Team: 8.5 FTE (10-50 range)
- All 10 stages enforced
- Full ADRs (14 architecture decision records)
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance ready

---

## 4. Quality Gates

Quality gates are checkpoints that block progression until criteria are met:

| Gate | Stage | Key Criteria | Approvers |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **G0.1** | 00 | Problem validated with 5+ users | PM + Stakeholder |
| **G0.2** | 00 | Solution diversity (100+ ideas → top 3) | PM + Design Lead |
| **G1** | 01 | Requirements complete, stakeholders approved | PM + Tech Lead |
| **G2** | 02 | Design approved by CTO/Tech Lead | CTO + Tech Lead |
| **G3** | 04-05 | Ship ready, tests passing (>90% coverage) | EM + QA Lead |
| **G4** | 06-07 | Production stable, runbook complete | EM + SRE |

### Gate Philosophy

**"Block early, fail fast"**

| Traditional Approach | SDLC 5.1.1 Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Validate in production | Validate at Gate G0.1 (before code) |
| Fix bugs after release | Catch issues at Gate G3 (before deploy) |
| Scramble for compliance | Collect evidence continuously |

---

## 5. SASE Integration (SE 3.0)

**SASE** (Software Agentic Software Engineering) defines how AI and humans collaborate:

### Two Roles

| Role | Description | Decision Authority |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **SE4H** (Agent Coach) | Human expertise - specifies intent, sets standards, approves | FINAL (veto power) |
| **SE4A** (Agent Executor) | AI implementation - executes plans, proposes solutions | NONE (propose only) |

### 6 SASE Artifacts

| Artifact | Created By | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **BRS** (BriefingScript) | SE4H | Specifies intent for AI task |
| **MTS** (MentorScript) | SE4H | Encodes team standards |
| **VCR** (Version Controlled Resolution) | SE4H | Approves AI output |
| **LPS** (LoopScript) | SE4A | Execution plan for task |
| **CRP** (Consultation Request Protocol) | SE4A | Escalates uncertainty to human |
| **MRP** (Merge-Readiness Pack) | SE4A | Evidence for merge approval |

### Agentic Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Characteristic | AI Autonomy |
|-------|------|----------------|-------------|
| **L0** | Tool-Assisted | AI as autocomplete | Minimal |
| **L1** | Agent-Assisted | Structured handoff (BRS/MRP/VCR) | Low |
| **L2** | Structured Agentic | Full SASE workflow | Medium |
| **L3** | Lifecycle Agentic | Proactive agents with memory | High |

**SDLC Orchestrator targets L1-L2 maturity** for most teams.

## 11. How SDLC Orchestrator Implements This Framework

### What You Can Do Manually (With Any Tools)

Teams can follow SDLC-Enterprise-Framework without SDLC Orchestrator:

| Framework Element | Manual Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| 10 Stages | Create folders in your repo: /docs/00-foundation, /docs/01-planning, etc. |
| Quality Gates | Use spreadsheets or checklists, get approvals via email/Slack |
| Evidence Collection | Save screenshots to Google Drive, link in Confluence |
| Policy Enforcement | Code review by senior engineers, manual checklists |
| SASE Artifacts | Create templates in Notion/Confluence |

**Pain Points of Manual Approach**:
- Time-consuming (60+ hours per audit cycle)
- Inconsistent (depends on team discipline)
- No automation (humans forget, skip steps)
- Evidence scattered across 6-10 tools

### What SDLC Orchestrator Automates

| Framework Element | SDLC Orchestrator Automation |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 10 Stages | **Stage-aware AI prompts** - AI knows which stage you're in, provides relevant templates |
| Quality Gates | **Gate Engine API** - Blocks progression until all criteria met, multi-approver workflow |
| Evidence Collection | **Evidence Vault** - Automatic capture, SHA256 hashing, 7-year immutable storage |
| Policy Enforcement | **Policy Guards (OPA)** - 100+ pre-built policies, automated validation on every commit |
| SASE Artifacts | **AI Context Engine** - Generates BRS, LPS, MRP templates with project context |
| Audit Compliance | **Compliance Dashboard** - Real-time status, one-click export for auditors |

### The Value Equation

```
Manual SDLC Framework:     20% of value (methodology alone)
+ SDLC Orchestrator:       80% of value (automation + enforcement)
= Complete Solution:       100% of value (methodology + automation)
```

**Key Insight**: The Framework provides the "what", the Orchestrator provides the "how". Together, they deliver measurable improvements in reliability, auditability, and delivery.

### Why We Separated Them

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Framework is Open Source** | Teams can evaluate and adopt the methodology before committing to the tool |
| **Tool-Agnostic Principles** | Framework works even if Orchestrator is replaced |
| **Vendor Independence** | Teams aren't locked into our tool to follow our principles |
| **Community Contribution** | Framework can evolve with industry input |

## 12. Questions for Expert Review

1. **Stage Completeness**: Are 10 stages appropriate, or is this over-engineered?
2. **Tier Classification**: Is the 4-tier system (team size-based) the right segmentation?
3. **SASE Complexity**: Is the AI+Human collaboration model (6 artifacts) too complex for adoption?
4. **Industry Alignment**: Are there standards we should align with that we've missed?
5. **Proven Results**: Are the stated outcomes credible and appropriately evidenced?

**The future is humans AND AI building the RIGHT things with COMPLETE lifecycle excellence.**
