# Product Roadmap
## Strategic Timeline and Delivery Milestones

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Date**: November 13, 2025
**Status**: ACTIVE - STAGE 00 FOUNDATION
**Authority**: CEO Approval (9.5/10 Confidence), Board Decision December 2024
**Foundation**: Financial Model v1.0, Stakeholder Alignment v1.0
**Stage**: Stage 00 (WHY - Project Foundation)
**Framework**: SDLC 4.9 Complete Lifecycle (10 Stages)

---

## Document Purpose (Stage 00 Focus: WHY)

This roadmap answers **WHY we're sequencing delivery this way**, not WHAT features or HOW they're implemented (Stage 01/02 scope).

**Key Questions Answered**:
- WHY 90 days for MVP? (Time-to-market vs quality tradeoff)
- WHY this gate sequence? (SDLC 4.9 methodology - 10 stages)
- WHY these milestones? (De-risk legal, validate market fit early)
- WHY this team allocation? (Critical path dependencies)

**Out of Scope** (Stage 01):
- Detailed sprint plans (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, etc.)
- Feature-level requirements (FR1-FR5 specs)
- Task-level breakdowns (Jira epics, stories, tasks)

---

## Executive Summary

### Timeline Overview
**Total Duration**: 90 days (13 weeks)
**Start Date**: November 14, 2025 (Week 1)
**MVP Launch**: February 10, 2026 (Week 13)
**First Revenue**: February 2026 (Week 14)

### Investment Phasing
| Phase | Duration | Investment | Gate |
|-------|----------|------------|------|
| **Foundation** | Week 1 | $15K | G0.1, G0.2 |
| **Planning** | Week 2 | $50K | G1 (Legal ✅), Market Validation |
| **Design** | Week 3-4 | $75K | G2 (Architecture ✅) |
| **Build** | Week 5-10 | $280K | G3 (5 Core Capabilities) |
| **Test** | Week 11 | $45K | G4 (Beta with 10 teams) |
| **Deploy** | Week 12 | $40K | G5 (Production ✅) |
| **Operate** | Week 13 | $48K | G6 (First 100 teams) |

**Total**: $553K (matches Financial Model)

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Legal Clearance Week 2** (CRITICAL PATH): AGPL containment strategy approved
2. **Beta Validation Week 11**: 10 teams, 70%+ Feature Adoption Rate
3. **First Revenue Week 14**: 100 teams × $20/team = $2K MRR (proof of PMF)

---

## Why 90 Days? (Time-to-Market Justification)

### Market Window Analysis

**Competitive Threat Timeline**:
- **Q4 2025**: Jira/Linear likely experimenting with AI+Policy (internal prototypes)
- **Q1 2026**: First competitive AI features may launch (basic, not SDLC-aware)
- **Q2 2026**: If we don't launch, competitors will close gap

**First-Mover Advantage Window**: **6-9 months** (November 2025 - July 2026)

**Why NOT Faster (60 days)**:
- Legal review requires 2 weeks (non-negotiable, AGPL risk)
- Beta testing requires 2 weeks (10 teams, real data)
- Design Thinking requires 1 week (evidence-based, not assumptions)

**Why NOT Slower (120 days)**:
- Competitive risk: Linear/Jira may launch AI features Q1 2026
- Financial risk: Burn $550K+ with no revenue validation
- Team risk: 4-month project = morale fatigue without wins

**Decision**: 90 days = **minimum viable time** to de-risk (legal, market, technical) while maintaining first-mover advantage.

---

## SDLC 4.9 Gate Sequence (WHY This Order)

### Gate Philosophy
Each gate answers a **fundamental risk** before burning resources on next stage.

**SDLC 4.9 Complete Lifecycle**: 10 stages (WHY → WHAT → HOW → BUILD → TEST → DEPLOY → OPERATE → INTEGRATE → COLLABORATE → GOVERN)

| Gate | Stage | Risk Validated | Investment at Risk | Exit Criteria |
|------|-------|----------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **G0.1** | Stage 00 (WHY - Problem Foundation) | Problem Definition | $15K (Foundation) | 3+ users validated, root causes identified |
| **G0.2** | Stage 00 (WHY - Business Case) | Solution Diversity | $15K | 3+ options evaluated, Option C chosen |
| **G1** | Stage 01 (WHAT - Requirements & Planning) | Legal + Market Fit | $50K (Planning) | AGPL strategy approved, 10 LOIs signed |
| **G2** | Stage 02 (HOW - Design & Architecture) | Technical Feasibility | $75K (Design) | Architecture reviewed, no technical blockers |
| **G3** | Stage 03 (BUILD - Development) | Build Quality | $280K (Development) | 5 core capabilities built, unit tested |
| **G4** | Stage 04 (TEST - Quality Assurance) | Market Validation | $45K (Testing) | 10 beta teams, 70%+ adoption, NPS 50+ |
| **G5** | Stage 05 (DEPLOY - Production Go-Live) | Production Readiness | $40K (Deploy) | SOC 2 Type I, 99.9% uptime, zero data loss |
| **G6** | Stage 06 (OPERATE - Production Excellence) | Business Viability | $48K (Operate) | 100 teams, $2K MRR, LTV:CAC >3:1 |
| **G7** | Stage 07 (INTEGRATE - Systems Integration) | Integration Quality | Ongoing | API contracts validated, integration tests ≥90% |
| **G8** | Stage 08 (COLLABORATE - Team Coordination) | Team Effectiveness | Ongoing | Documentation ≥90%, velocity stable ±20% |
| **G9** | Stage 09 (GOVERN - Strategic Oversight) | Governance & Compliance | Ongoing | Zero violations, budget ±10%, stakeholder ≥8/10 |

### Why G1 (Legal) is Week 2 (CRITICAL PATH)

**Risk If We Fail G1**:
- AGPL contamination = cannot sell proprietary version
- $550K investment = 100% write-off
- 8.5 FTE × 3 months = careers impacted

**Why Week 2** (not Week 1):
- Need Foundation docs (Stage 00) to brief legal counsel
- Need architecture draft (Option C) to evaluate AGPL exposure
- Legal review requires 5-7 business days (external counsel)

**Go/No-Go Decision**: End of Week 2
- ✅ GO: Legal approves AGPL containment strategy
- 🔴 NO-GO: Legal cannot approve → pivot to pure OSS (no SaaS) OR full proprietary rewrite

---

## 90-Day Development Timeline

### Week 1 (November 14-18, 2025): Foundation
**Stage**: 00 (WHY - Project Foundation)
**Team**: PM (1.0 FTE), Designer (0.5 FTE)
**Investment**: $15K

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Product Vision (completed)
- [x] Business Case (Financial Model, BRD, Stakeholder Alignment) (completed)
- [x] Design Thinking (6 docs: Personas, Problem Statement, POV, HMW, Empathy Maps, Journey Maps) (completed)
- [ ] Product Roadmap (this document) (in progress)
- [ ] Market Analysis (3 docs: Competitive Landscape, Market Sizing, OSS Research)

**Gates**:
- ✅ G0.1 PASSED: Problem validated (10+ interviews, 60-70% waste confirmed)
- [ ] G0.2 PENDING: Solution diversity (3+ options evaluated, Option C chosen)

**Exit Criteria**:
- All 14 Stage 00 documents completed
- CEO/CTO/CPO alignment (9.5/8.5/9.0 scores achieved ✅)
- 3+ external user validations

**Why Foundation First**:
- Without clear problem definition, we build the wrong thing
- Without stakeholder alignment, project dies in Week 5 (scope creep)
- Without Design Thinking, we miss user needs (repeat 70% waste)

---

### Week 2 (November 21-25, 2025): Planning + Legal (CRITICAL)
**Stage**: 01 (WHAT - Planning & Analysis)
**Team**: Full team (8.5 FTE)
**Investment**: $50K

**Deliverables**:
- Functional Requirements Document (FR1-FR5 detailed specs)
- System Requirements (performance, security, compliance)
- Legal Review Report (AGPL containment strategy)
- Market Validation (10 LOIs from beta teams)
- Data Model v1.0 (entities, relationships, schema)

**Gates**:
- [ ] G1: Planning & Analysis validated

**G1 Exit Criteria** (CRITICAL - Go/No-Go Decision):
- ✅ Legal approval for AGPL containment (MinIO/Grafana isolation)
- ✅ 10 LOIs signed (beta teams committed)
- ✅ FR1-FR5 specs complete (Gate Engine, Evidence Vault, AI Assistance, Dashboard, Policy Packs)
- ✅ Data model reviewed (CTO approval)

**Why Week 2 is CRITICAL PATH**:
1. **Legal Risk**: If AGPL contamination detected, entire architecture must pivot
2. **Market Risk**: If cannot get 10 LOIs, PMF questionable
3. **Technical Risk**: If data model flawed, entire system built on wrong foundation

**Contingency Plan** (if G1 fails):
- **Legal Failure**: Pivot to pure OSS (Apache-2.0) OR full proprietary rewrite (no MinIO/Grafana)
- **Market Failure**: Extend beta recruitment 1 week, lower bar to 5 LOIs (vs 10)
- **Technical Failure**: Architecture review workshop (CTO + 2 external advisors)

---

### Week 3-4 (November 28 - December 9, 2025): Design + Architecture
**Stage**: 02 (HOW - Design & Architecture)
**Team**: Full team (8.5 FTE)
**Investment**: $75K

**Deliverables**:
- System Architecture Document (4-layer architecture detailed)
- API Design (REST endpoints, GraphQL schema, webhooks)
- Database Schema (PostgreSQL tables, indexes, migrations)
- UI/UX Design (Figma prototypes for Dashboard, VS Code Extension)
- Security Architecture (RBAC, encryption, audit logging)
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform for AWS, docker-compose for local)

**Gates**:
- [ ] G2: Design & Architecture validated

**G2 Exit Criteria**:
- ✅ Architecture reviewed (CTO + 1 external advisor)
- ✅ API design reviewed (Backend Lead approval)
- ✅ Database schema reviewed (no N+1 queries, proper indexes)
- ✅ UI/UX prototypes tested (5 users, SUS score >70)
- ✅ Security review complete (no OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities)

**Why 2 Weeks for Design**:
- **Complexity**: 4-layer architecture (user-facing, business logic, integration, infrastructure)
- **Risk**: Wrong architecture = 6-week rebuild in Week 8 (seen in Bflow Platform)
- **Dependencies**: Backend, Frontend, Infra teams all blocked until API design finalized

**Design Principles** (from Option C):
1. **Thin Integration Layer**: Avoid AGPL contamination (MinIO/Grafana calls isolated)
2. **API-First**: Frontend/Backend decouple (parallel development Week 5+)
3. **Policy-as-Code**: 100+ SDLC 4.8 policy packs (moat vs competitors)

---

### Week 5-10 (December 12, 2025 - January 20, 2026): Development (BUILD)
**Stage**: 03 (BUILD - Development & Implementation)
**Team**: Full team (8.5 FTE)
**Investment**: $280K (50% of budget)

**Deliverables** (5 Core Capabilities):

**Capability 1: Quality Gate Management** (Week 5-6, $56K)
- Gate Engine (OPA wrapper, policy evaluation)
- Gate Dashboard (React, real-time status)
- VS Code Extension (gate checks on git push)
- 20 policy packs (G0.1, G0.2, G1, G2)

**Capability 2: Evidence Vault** (Week 6-7, $56K)
- MinIO integration (S3-compatible storage)
- Evidence API (upload, retrieve, search)
- Auto-collection (GitHub webhooks, Slack integration)
- Encryption (AES-256, at-rest + in-transit)

**Capability 3: AI Context Engine** (Week 7-8, $56K)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 integration (primary)
- GPT-4o + Gemini 2.0 (fallback)
- Stage-aware prompts (00-06, 3000+ lines)
- Context builder (project state, gate status, evidence)

**Capability 4: Real-Time Dashboard** (Week 8-9, $56K)
- React + TypeScript (frontend)
- FastAPI + PostgreSQL (backend)
- Grafana integration (metrics visualization)
- RBAC (EM/CTO/PM roles)

**Capability 5: Policy Pack Library** (Week 9-10, $56K)
- 100+ SDLC 4.8 policy packs (Rego language)
- Policy editor (VS Code-like, syntax highlighting)
- Policy testing framework (unit tests for policies)
- Policy versioning (Git-based)

**Gates**:
- [ ] G3: Build Quality validated

**G3 Exit Criteria**:
- ✅ 5 core capabilities built (100% feature complete)
- ✅ Unit test coverage >80% (pytest, Jest)
- ✅ Integration tests passing (Gate Engine + Evidence Vault + AI)
- ✅ Code review complete (CTO approval, no critical bugs)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met (Gate check <500ms, Evidence upload <2s)

**Why 6 Weeks for Development**:
- **Scope**: 5 capabilities × 10K LOC each = 50K LOC (estimated)
- **Team**: 4 engineers × 6 weeks = 24 engineer-weeks
- **Risk**: AI integration untested (Claude API rate limits, context window limits)

**Development Milestones** (internal checkpoints):
- **Week 5 End**: Capability 1 (Gate Engine) demo-ready
- **Week 7 End**: Capability 1+2 (Gate + Evidence) integrated
- **Week 9 End**: Capability 1+2+3 (Gate + Evidence + AI) end-to-end demo
- **Week 10 End**: All 5 capabilities feature-complete

---

### Week 11 (January 23-27, 2026): Testing (BETA)
**Stage**: 04 (TEST - Testing & Quality Assurance)
**Team**: Full team (8.5 FTE) + 10 beta teams
**Investment**: $45K

**Deliverables**:
- Beta program (10 teams onboarded)
- Test plan (functional, integration, performance, security)
- Bug triage (P0/P1 fixed, P2+ backlog)
- NPS survey (beta teams)
- Feature Adoption Rate analysis

**Gates**:
- [ ] G4: Testing & Market Validation

**G4 Exit Criteria** (CRITICAL - MVP Go/No-Go):
- ✅ 10 beta teams onboarded (5 EMs, 3 CTOs, 2 PMs)
- ✅ **70%+ Feature Adoption Rate** (vs 30% baseline)
- ✅ **NPS 50+** (industry SaaS avg = 30-40)
- ✅ Zero P0 bugs (system-breaking)
- ✅ <5 P1 bugs (user-blocking, must fix pre-launch)

**Beta Team Profile**:
- **5 Engineering Managers**: 6-50 engineer teams (60% of market)
- **3 CTOs**: 50-500 engineer teams (30% of market)
- **2 Product Managers**: Managing 6-20 engineers (10% of market)

**Why 1 Week for Beta**:
- **Risk**: If Feature Adoption <70%, PMF not validated → extend 1 week
- **Data**: 10 teams × 5 features × 2 weeks usage = 100 data points (statistically significant)
- **Timeline**: Week 11 = latest point to pivot before launch (Week 12)

**Beta Success Metrics**:
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Stretch |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| Feature Adoption Rate | 30% | **70%** | 85% |
| NPS | N/A | **50** | 70 |
| Time to First Value | N/A | <1 hour | <30 min |
| Gate Pass Rate | N/A | 80% | 90% |

**Contingency Plan** (if G4 fails):
- **Adoption <70%**: Root cause analysis (UX? Onboarding? Value prop?), extend beta 1 week
- **NPS <50**: User interviews (5 detractors), prioritize top 3 pain points
- **P0 bugs**: Delay launch 1 week, all hands on deck

---

### Week 12 (January 30 - February 3, 2026): Deployment (LAUNCH)
**Stage**: 05 (DEPLOY - Deployment & Release)
**Team**: Full team (8.5 FTE)
**Investment**: $40K

**Deliverables**:
- Production infrastructure (AWS, Terraform)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, auto-deploy)
- Monitoring (Grafana dashboards, Prometheus alerts)
- SOC 2 Type I audit (started, 6-month process)
- Launch marketing (website, docs, demo video)

**Gates**:
- [ ] G5: Production Readiness

**G5 Exit Criteria**:
- ✅ Production deployed (AWS us-east-1, multi-AZ)
- ✅ 99.9% uptime SLA (monitored, alerts configured)
- ✅ Zero data loss (backup tested, disaster recovery plan)
- ✅ SOC 2 Type I audit started (controls documented)
- ✅ Documentation complete (user docs, API docs, admin docs)

**Launch Checklist**:
- [ ] Production infrastructure provisioned (Terraform apply)
- [ ] Database migrated (PostgreSQL 15.5, schema v1.0)
- [ ] Secrets rotated (API keys, database passwords)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards live (Grafana)
- [ ] Backup tested (restore from backup successful)
- [ ] DDoS protection enabled (Cloudflare)
- [ ] SSL certificates installed (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] DNS configured (sdlc-orchestrator.com)

**Why 1 Week for Deploy**:
- **Automation**: Terraform + GitHub Actions = 80% automated
- **Risk**: Manual deploy = high error rate, automated = repeatable
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type I requires documented controls (started Week 12, completed Month 6)

**Launch Strategy**:
- **Soft Launch**: Week 12 Monday (beta teams first)
- **Public Launch**: Week 12 Thursday (ProductHunt, HN, LinkedIn)
- **First 100 Teams**: Week 13-14 (funnel: 1000 visitors → 100 signups → 100 teams)

---

### Week 13 (February 6-10, 2026): Operations (FIRST REVENUE)
**Stage**: 06 (OPERATE - Operations & Maintenance)
**Team**: Full team (8.5 FTE)
**Investment**: $48K

**Deliverables**:
- First 100 teams onboarded
- Support playbook (Slack community, email support)
- Revenue tracking (Stripe integration, MRR dashboard)
- Customer success (onboarding calls, weekly check-ins)
- Bug fixes (P1 bugs from production)

**Gates**:
- [ ] G6: Business Viability

**G6 Exit Criteria** (PROOF OF PRODUCT-MARKET FIT):
- ✅ **100 teams paying** ($20/team × 100 = **$2K MRR**)
- ✅ **LTV:CAC >3:1** (target 4.08:1 from Financial Model)
- ✅ **Gross Margin >70%** (target 72% from Financial Model)
- ✅ **Churn <5%/month** (SaaS healthy <5%)
- ✅ **NPS 50+** (consistent with beta)

**Why Week 13 is "First Revenue"**:
- **Proof**: 100 teams × $20/team = $2K MRR (not $0)
- **Validation**: Real teams paying = PMF validated (not just beta testers)
- **Momentum**: $2K MRR Month 1 → $10K Month 3 → $50K Month 6 (if PMF true)

**Revenue Model** (from Financial Model):
- **Month 1** (February 2026): 100 teams × $20 = $2K MRR
- **Month 2** (March 2026): 151 teams × $20 = $3K MRR (51% MoM growth)
- **Month 3** (April 2026): 228 teams × $20 = $4.6K MRR (51% MoM growth)
- **Month 12** (January 2027): 1,000 teams × $20 = $20K MRR

**Contingency Plan** (if G6 fails):
- **<100 teams**: Extend GTM 2 weeks, lower price to $15/team (vs $20)
- **LTV:CAC <3:1**: Optimize funnel (reduce CAC $2,650 → $2,000)
- **Churn >5%**: Root cause analysis (feature gaps? onboarding? support?)

## Dependencies and Critical Path

### Critical Path Analysis (PERT Chart)

**Longest Path** (cannot be parallelized):
1. Legal Review (Week 2): **5 days** (external dependency)
2. Architecture Design (Week 3-4): **10 days** (blocks all development)
3. Gate Engine Development (Week 5-6): **10 days** (blocks Evidence Vault integration)
4. AI Integration (Week 7-8): **10 days** (blocks end-to-end testing)
5. Beta Testing (Week 11): **5 days** (real users, cannot simulate)

**Total Critical Path**: **40 days** (out of 90 days = 44% of timeline)

### Dependency Map

```
Week 1 (Foundation)
  └─> Week 2 (Legal Review) [CRITICAL - Go/No-Go]
        └─> Week 3-4 (Architecture) [BLOCKS Week 5-10]
              ├─> Week 5-6 (Gate Engine) [BLOCKS Evidence Vault]
              │     └─> Week 7-8 (AI Integration) [BLOCKS Dashboard]
              │           └─> Week 9-10 (Policy Packs) [BLOCKS Beta]

              └─> Week 5-10 (DevOps) [PARALLEL with Backend/Frontend]
```

### Risk Mitigation (Critical Path)

**Risk 1: Legal Review Delays** (Week 2)
- **Mitigation**: Pre-brief legal counsel Week 1, provide all docs upfront
- **Contingency**: If delayed >2 days, escalate to CEO (legal is external blocker)

**Risk 2: Architecture Redesign** (Week 3-4)
- **Mitigation**: External CTO review (prevent groupthink)
- **Contingency**: If major flaw found Week 4, allocate Week 5 to redesign (push Build to Week 6-11)

**Risk 3: AI API Rate Limits** (Week 7-8)
- **Mitigation**: Multi-provider strategy (Claude + GPT-4o + Gemini fallback)
- **Contingency**: If Claude API unstable, switch primary to GPT-4o (lower quality, but reliable)

## Risk Register (Top 10 Risks)

### 1. Legal Risk (AGPL Contamination)
**Impact**: 10/10 (project killer)
**Probability**: 3/10 (low, containment strategy designed)
**Mitigation**: External legal counsel review Week 2, AGPL services isolated (docker-compose, separate processes)
**Contingency**: Pivot to pure OSS (Apache-2.0) OR full proprietary rewrite

### 2. Market Risk (PMF Not Validated)
**Impact**: 9/10 (business failure)
**Probability**: 4/10 (medium, 10+ interviews reduce risk)
**Mitigation**: Beta with 10 teams Week 11, 70%+ adoption target
**Contingency**: Extend beta 1 week, pivot features based on feedback

### 3. Competitive Risk (Jira/Linear Launch AI)
**Impact**: 8/10 (first-mover advantage lost)
**Probability**: 5/10 (medium, Q2 2025 likely)
**Mitigation**: 90-day timeline (aggressive), SDLC 4.8 moat (1-2 years to replicate)
**Contingency**: Accelerate launch 1 week (cut non-critical features)

### 4. Technical Risk (AI API Instability)
**Impact**: 7/10 (core feature broken)
**Probability**: 4/10 (Claude API beta, some instability)
**Mitigation**: Multi-provider strategy (Claude + GPT-4o + Gemini)
**Contingency**: Switch primary provider GPT-4o (lower quality, higher reliability)

### 5. Team Risk (Key Engineer Quits)
**Impact**: 8/10 (development delayed 2-4 weeks)
**Probability**: 2/10 (low, 90-day project = low burnout)
**Mitigation**: 8.5 FTE team (redundancy), cross-training
**Contingency**: Contract engineer (1-2 week ramp-up)

### 6. Financial Risk (Burn >$553K)
**Impact**: 7/10 (budget overrun, dilution)
**Probability**: 3/10 (10% contingency buffer)
**Mitigation**: Weekly budget tracking, $10K contingency reserve
**Contingency**: Reduce scope (cut Policy Pack library from 100 to 50)

### 7. Compliance Risk (SOC 2 Delays)
**Impact**: 6/10 (Enterprise sales blocked)
**Probability**: 5/10 (6-month audit process, delays common)
**Mitigation**: Start Week 12, engage auditor early
**Contingency**: Self-certification interim (90% controls), Enterprise sales Q4 (vs Q3)

### 8. Security Risk (Data Breach)
**Impact**: 10/10 (reputational catastrophe, legal liability)
**Probability**: 1/10 (low, encryption + RBAC + audit logging)
**Mitigation**: Security review Week 4, penetration testing Week 12
**Contingency**: Incident response plan (notify users <24 hours, forensics, legal counsel)

### 9. Operational Risk (Infrastructure Outage)
**Impact**: 7/10 (SLA breach, churn)
**Probability**: 3/10 (AWS multi-AZ, 99.99% SLA)
**Mitigation**: Multi-AZ deployment, auto-scaling, Prometheus alerts
**Contingency**: Disaster recovery plan (restore from backup <1 hour)

### 10. GTM Risk (Cannot Acquire 100 Teams)
**Impact**: 8/10 (revenue target missed, PMF questionable)
**Probability**: 4/10 (CAC $2,650 high, funnel untested)
**Mitigation**: 10 LOIs Week 2, ProductHunt/HN launch Week 12
**Contingency**: Lower price $20 → $15/team (increase volume), extend to Week 14

## Lessons from Similar Projects

### Bflow Platform (Internal Reference)
**Timeline**: 6 months (vs our 90 days)
**Outcome**: 32% adoption (vs our 70% target)

**What Went Wrong**:
1. No Design Thinking (built features users didn't need)
2. No beta testing (launched to 100% of users, 68% ignored it)
3. Architecture redesign Week 8 (cost 2 weeks, wrong API design)

**What We'll Do Differently**:
1. ✅ Design Thinking Week 1 (6 docs: Personas, Problem, POV, HMW, Empathy, Journey)
2. ✅ Beta with 10 teams Week 11 (validate 70%+ adoption before full launch)
3. ✅ External CTO review Week 4 (prevent architecture groupthink)

### Industry Benchmarks (SaaS Startups)
**Median Time to MVP**: 6-9 months
**Median First Revenue**: Month 4-6
**Median PMF Validation**: Month 6-12

**Our Aggressive Timeline**:
- MVP: 3 months (vs 6-9 median) = **50% faster**
- First Revenue: Month 1 (vs Month 4-6) = **4-6x faster**
- PMF Validation: Month 3 (vs Month 6-12) = **2-4x faster**

**Why We Can Be Faster**:
1. **Experienced Team**: 8.5 FTE with SDLC 4.8 expertise (not learning)
2. **Validated Problem**: 10+ interviews, 60-70% waste confirmed (not guessing)
3. **OSS Leverage**: OPA + MinIO + Grafana (not building from scratch)
4. **AI Acceleration**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (code generation, design review)

**Risk of Speed**:
- Technical debt (cut corners in Week 5-10)
- Burnout (8.5 FTE × 90 days = high intensity)
- Quality issues (bugs in production)

**Mitigation**:
- 80%+ test coverage (non-negotiable)
- Weekly retros (adjust pace if burnout signals)
- 10% contingency buffer ($10K, 1 week)
