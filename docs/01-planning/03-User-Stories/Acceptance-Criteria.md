    - Total users: 100
    - Active users (past 30 days): 25 (25% adoption)
    - Reasons for low adoption:
      - 40% don't know feature exists (lack of awareness)
      - 35% find feature hard to use (usability issue)
      - 25% don't see value (feature-market fit issue)
  And CPO sees recommended actions:
    - "Increase awareness: Send Slack announcement + onboarding email"
    - "Improve usability: Run SUS survey, fix top 3 issues"
    - "Validate value: Interview 10 non-users, understand pain points"
```

### US5.2: Embed Grafana Dashboard

**Story**: As a DevOps Lead, I want to embed Grafana dashboards in the SDLC Orchestrator dashboard, so that I can view metrics (CPU, memory, API latency) without switching tools.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: DevOps Lead embeds Grafana dashboard
  Given DevOps Lead logged in
  When DevOps Lead navigates to Dashboard → Metrics → Grafana
  Then DevOps Lead sees embedded Grafana iframe:
    - Dashboard: "SDLC Orchestrator - API Metrics"
    - Panels:
      - API Response Time (p50, p95, p99)
      - Gate Evaluation Time (p50, p95, p99)
      - Evidence Upload Time (p50, p95, p99)
      - Database Query Time (p50, p95, p99)
    - Time range: Past 24 hours (configurable)
  And iframe loads <2s
  And DevOps Lead can interact with Grafana (zoom, filter)

Scenario: DevOps Lead receives alert from Grafana
  Given Grafana alert configured:
    - Metric: API Response Time (p95)
    - Threshold: >500ms
    - Action: Slack notification
  When API response time exceeds 500ms (p95)
  Then Grafana sends alert to Slack:
    "⚠️ ALERT: API Response Time p95 = 550ms (threshold: 500ms). Dashboard: [link]"
  And DevOps Lead sees alert in SDLC Orchestrator dashboard (real-time)
```

## Epic 6: VS Code Extension (5 Stories)

### US6.1: Gate Check on Git Push

**Story**: As a Dev Lead, I want to auto-check gate status on git push, so that I can catch SDLC compliance issues before code review.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Dev Lead pushes code (gate PASSED)
  Given Dev Lead working on project "New-Feature-X"
  And gate G3 (Build) status = PASSED
  When Dev Lead runs `git push origin main`
  Then VS Code Extension triggers gate check (pre-push hook)
  And gate evaluation runs (FR1.2)
  And gate status = PASSED
  And git push proceeds (no blocking)
  And Dev Lead sees notification in VS Code:
    "✅ Gate G3 PASSED. Code pushed to origin/main."

Scenario: Dev Lead pushes code (gate BLOCKED)
  Given gate G3 status = BLOCKED (policy-unit-tests failed)
  When Dev Lead runs `git push origin main`
  Then VS Code Extension triggers gate check
  And gate status = BLOCKED
  And git push aborted (pre-push hook blocks)
  And Dev Lead sees error message in VS Code:
    "❌ Gate G3 BLOCKED. Cannot push to main. Reason: Unit tests failed (10 tests failing)."
  And Dev Lead sees recommended actions:
    - "Fix failing tests: run `npm test` to see failures"
    - "Request override: click here to request CTO override"

Scenario: Dev Lead bypasses gate check (force push)
  Given gate G3 status = BLOCKED
  When Dev Lead runs `git push origin main --no-verify`
  Then git push proceeds (bypass hook)
  And audit log entry created:
    - user_id: Dev Lead
    - action: "gate_bypass"
    - gate_id: G3
  And CTO receives notification:
    "⚠️ Dev Lead bypassed G3 gate check (force push). Review required."
```
