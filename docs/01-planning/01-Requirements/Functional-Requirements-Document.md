## FR1: Quality Gate Management

### Overview

**Capability**: Automated enforcement of SDLC 5.1.3 quality gates using Policy-as-Code (OPA).

**Business Value**: Prevent 70% feature waste by validating BEFORE building (Design Thinking gates).

**User Personas**:
- Engineering Manager: Ensure team meets quality standards
- CTO: Enforce governance without manual reviews
- Product Manager: Validate user needs before engineering starts

---

### FR1.1: Gate Orchestration Engine

#### Use Case 1.1.1: Create Quality Gate

**Actor**: Engineering Manager
**Precondition**: User authenticated, project exists
**Trigger**: User clicks "Create Gate" button

**Main Flow**:
1. User selects gate type (G0.1 Design Thinking, G1 Design Ready, G2 Build Ready, etc.)
2. System displays gate template with required evidence fields
3. User fills required metadata:
   - Gate name (e.g., "User Authentication - Gate G1")
   - Stage (WHY, WHAT, HOW, BUILD, TEST, DEPLOY, OPERATE)
   - Exit criteria (auto-populated from policy pack)
   - Approvers (CEO, CTO, CPO - role-based)
4. System creates gate record in PostgreSQL
5. System initializes evidence vault (empty, pending submission)
6. System displays gate status: "Draft" (not submitted for review)

**Postcondition**: Gate created with status "Draft", evidence vault initialized.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: User can create gate in <5 seconds
- AC2: System validates required fields (name, stage, approvers)
- AC3: System auto-populates exit criteria from SDLC 5.1.3 policy pack
- AC4: System supports all 10 SDLC stages (WHY → GOVERN)
- AC5: System supports role-based approver selection (CEO, CTO, CPO, CIO, CFO)

---

#### Use Case 1.1.2: Submit Gate for Review

**Actor**: Engineering Lead
**Precondition**: Gate in "Draft" status, all required evidence uploaded
**Trigger**: User clicks "Submit for Review" button

**Main Flow**:
1. User navigates to gate detail page
2. System displays evidence checklist (exit criteria vs uploaded evidence)
3. User reviews completeness:
   - Green checkmarks: Evidence uploaded + policy passed
   - Red X: Evidence missing OR policy failed
4. User clicks "Submit for Review"
5. System runs OPA policy validation:
   - Query: `data.sdlc.gates.g1.design_ready`
   - Input: All uploaded evidence + metadata
   - Output: Pass/Fail + policy violations
6. **IF** policy passes:
   - System updates gate status: "Draft" → "Pending Approval"
   - System sends notifications to approvers (Slack, email)
   - System locks evidence vault (no more uploads until decision)
7. **IF** policy fails:
   - System displays violations (e.g., "TDD tests missing", "API contract incomplete")
   - System keeps gate in "Draft" status
   - System allows user to fix and re-submit

**Postcondition**: Gate in "Pending Approval" status, approvers notified.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: System validates ALL exit criteria before allowing submission
- AC2: System runs OPA policy check in <2 seconds (async for large evidence)
- AC3: System provides clear error messages for policy violations (with links to missing evidence)
- AC4: System locks evidence vault after submission (prevent tampering)
- AC5: System sends real-time notifications (Slack webhook, email)

**API Contract**:
```typescript
POST /api/v1/gates/{gate_id}/submit
Request: {} (no body, gate_id in URL)

Response (200 OK - Policy Passed):

#### Use Case 1.1.3: Approve/Reject Gate

**Actor**: CTO (Approver)
**Precondition**: Gate in "Pending Approval" status
**Trigger**: Approver receives notification, clicks "Review Gate"

**Main Flow**:
1. Approver navigates to gate review page
2. System displays:
   - Gate metadata (name, stage, submitter, date)
   - Evidence summary (all uploaded files + policy results)
   - Exit criteria checklist (policy-validated)
   - Comments from other approvers (if multi-approval)
3. Approver reviews evidence:
   - Downloads evidence files (TDD tests, API contracts, etc.)
   - Reads AI-generated summary (Claude: "Gate summary in 3 bullet points")
   - Checks policy validation results (OPA decision log)
4. Approver makes decision:
   - **Approve**: Add comment (optional), click "Approve"
   - **Reject**: Add comment (required), click "Reject"
5. System updates gate approval record:
   - Records approver, decision, timestamp, comment
6. **IF** all approvers approved:
   - System updates gate status: "Pending Approval" → "Approved"
   - System unlocks next stage (e.g., G1 approved → BUILD stage enabled)
   - System sends notification to submitter (Slack, email)
7. **IF** any approver rejected:
   - System updates gate status: "Pending Approval" → "Rejected"
   - System unlocks evidence vault (allow re-submission)
   - System sends notification to submitter with rejection reasons

**Postcondition**: Gate approved/rejected, submitter notified, next stage enabled (if approved).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Approver can review evidence without leaving platform (inline file viewer)
- AC2: System requires comment for rejection (mandatory feedback)
- AC3: System supports multi-approval workflow (all approvers must approve)
- AC4: System prevents duplicate approvals (same user can't approve twice)
- AC5: System auto-unlocks next stage within 1 second of final approval

### FR1.2: OPA Policy Engine Integration

#### Use Case 1.2.1: Validate Evidence Against Policy

**Actor**: System (automated)
**Precondition**: Evidence uploaded, gate submitted for review
**Trigger**: User clicks "Submit for Review" (triggers policy check)

**Main Flow**:
1. System collects all evidence from vault:
   - Files: TDD tests (Python), API contracts (OpenAPI YAML), ERD (PNG/PDF)
   - Metadata: File count, total size, SHA256 hashes
2. System prepares OPA input document:
   ```json
   {
     "gate": {
       "id": "uuid",
       "type": "G1_DESIGN_READY",
       "stage": "WHAT"
     },
     "evidence": {
       "tdd_tests": {
         "file_count": 5,
         "lines_of_code": 350,
         "test_coverage": 0, // Not applicable at design stage
         "sha256": "abc123..."
       },
       "api_contracts": {
         "file_path": "evidence/api-contracts.yaml",
         "endpoints_count": 12,
         "sha256": "def456..."
       },
       "database_schema": {
         "file_path": "evidence/schema.sql",
         "tables_count": 8,
         "sha256": "ghi789..."
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. System queries OPA:
   - HTTP POST to `http://opa:8181/v1/data/sdlc/gates/g1/design_ready`
   - Input: Evidence document (JSON)
   - Timeout: 5 seconds (fail-safe if OPA unreachable)
4. OPA evaluates policy:
   ```rego
   package sdlc.gates.g1

   # Gate G1: Design Ready (WHAT Stage)
   design_ready = decision {
     decision := {
       "allowed": allowed,
       "violations": violations
     }
   }

   # Exit Criterion 1: TDD tests exist
   allowed {
     input.evidence.tdd_tests.file_count > 0
     input.evidence.tdd_tests.lines_of_code >= 100
   }

   # Exit Criterion 2: API contracts complete
   allowed {
     input.evidence.api_contracts.endpoints_count >= 5
   }

   # Exit Criterion 3: Database schema designed
   allowed {
     input.evidence.database_schema.tables_count > 0
   }

   # Collect violations
   violations[msg] {
     input.evidence.tdd_tests.file_count == 0
     msg := "G1-EC1-MISSING: TDD test cases not found"
   }
   ```
5. OPA returns decision:
   ```json
   {
     "result": {
       "allowed": false,
       "violations": ["G1-EC1-MISSING: TDD test cases not found"]
     }
   }
   ```
6. System processes OPA response:
   - **IF** `allowed == true`: Allow gate submission
   - **IF** `allowed == false`: Block submission, display violations

**Postcondition**: Policy decision recorded, gate status updated.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: System evaluates policy within 2 seconds (95th percentile)
- AC2: System handles OPA timeout gracefully (default to "fail-safe" rejection)
- AC3: System logs all policy decisions to audit trail (PostgreSQL + MinIO)
- AC4: System supports 10+ gate types (G0.1, G0.2, G1... G9)
- AC5: System allows policy customization via Web UI (advanced feature, Week 6+)

**API Contract**:
```typescript
POST /api/v1/gates/{gate_id}/validate-policy
Request: {} // No body, uses gate_id to fetch evidence

Response (200 OK - Policy Passed):
{
  "gate_id": "uuid",
  "policy_result": {
    "decision": "PASS",
    "violations": [],
    "evaluated_at": "2025-11-21T11:00:00Z",
    "opa_version": "0.58.0",
    "policy_version": "sdlc-4.9-v1.0"
  }
}

Response (200 OK - Policy Failed):
{
  "gate_id": "uuid",
  "policy_result": {
    "decision": "FAIL",
    "violations": [
      {
        "code": "G1-EC1-MISSING",
        "message": "TDD test cases not found in evidence vault",
        "remediation": "Upload test cases to /evidence/tdd-tests/",
        "severity": "CRITICAL"
      }
    ],
    "evaluated_at": "2025-11-21T11:00:00Z",
    "opa_version": "0.58.0",
    "policy_version": "sdlc-4.9-v1.0"
  }
}

Response (503 Service Unavailable - OPA Timeout):
{
  "error": "OPA_TIMEOUT",
  "message": "Policy engine unreachable after 5 seconds",
  "fallback_decision": "FAIL",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

**Infrastructure Requirements**:
- OPA container: `openpolicyagent/opa:0.58.0-rootless`
- Network: Backend → OPA via HTTP (docker-compose network)
- Policy storage: PostgreSQL (policy bundles table)
- Policy versioning: Git-based (policies/ directory)

### FR1.3: Stage Progression Control

#### Use Case 1.3.1: Unlock Next Stage After Gate Approval

**Actor**: System (automated)
**Precondition**: Gate approved by all required approvers
**Trigger**: Final approver clicks "Approve"

**Main Flow**:
1. System detects final approval (all approvers voted "APPROVE")
2. System looks up gate type → next stage mapping:
   - G0.1 (Design Thinking) → WHAT stage unlocked
   - G0.2 (Solution Diversity) → HOW stage unlocked
   - G1 (Design Ready) → BUILD stage unlocked
   - G2 (Build Ready) → TEST stage unlocked
   - G3 (Ship Ready) → DEPLOY stage unlocked
   - ... (all 10 stages)
3. System updates project stage:
   - `projects` table: `current_stage = 'BUILD'` (example)
   - `stage_history` table: Insert transition record (WHAT → BUILD)
4. System enables next stage features:
   - Creates GitHub branch: `build/feature-name`
   - Enables BUILD stage AI prompts (Claude context switch)
   - Shows BUILD stage checklist in dashboard
5. System sends notification:
   - Slack: "#engineering - Gate G1 APPROVED 🎉 BUILD stage unlocked"
   - Email: "Your gate was approved, you can start coding now"

**Postcondition**: Next stage unlocked, team can proceed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: System unlocks next stage within 1 second of final approval
- AC2: System prevents skipping stages (cannot go WHAT → DEPLOY without HOW/BUILD/TEST)
- AC3: System supports parallel stage work (advanced: multiple features in different stages)
- AC4: System tracks stage history (audit trail for compliance)
- AC5: System integrates with GitHub (auto-create branch for BUILD stage)

**API Contract**:
```typescript
POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/unlock-stage
Request:
{
  "gate_id": "uuid",
  "approved_stage": "WHAT",
  "next_stage": "BUILD"
}

Response (200 OK):
{
  "project_id": "uuid",
  "previous_stage": "WHAT",
  "current_stage": "BUILD",
  "unlocked_at": "2025-11-21T14:35:01Z",
  "github_branch_created": "build/user-authentication",
  "ai_context_updated": true,
  "notification_sent": true
}

Response (400 Bad Request - Stage Skip Detected):
{
  "error": "STAGE_SKIP_VIOLATION",
  "message": "Cannot unlock DEPLOY stage without passing TEST stage",
  "current_stage": "BUILD",
  "requested_stage": "DEPLOY",
  "missing_gates": ["G2_BUILD_READY", "G3_SHIP_READY"]
}
```

2. System displays evidence checklist (from exit criteria):
   - G1 Design Ready:
     - ☐ TDD Test Cases (Python files)
     - ☐ API Contracts (OpenAPI YAML)
     - ☐ Database Schema (SQL + ERD)
3. User selects evidence type (dropdown: "TDD Test Cases")
4. User drags file or clicks "Browse" (multi-file upload supported)
5. System validates file:
   - Size: Max 100 MB per file
   - Type: Allowed extensions (.py, .yaml, .sql, .png, .pdf)
   - Virus scan: ClamAV (async, results in 5 seconds)
6. System computes SHA256 hash (client-side + server-side verification)
7. System uploads file to MinIO:
   - Bucket: `sdlc-evidence`
   - Path: `{project_id}/{gate_id}/{evidence_type}/{filename}`
   - Metadata: SHA256, uploader, timestamp
8. System records evidence in PostgreSQL:
   - Table: `gate_evidence`
   - Columns: `gate_id`, `evidence_type`, `file_path`, `sha256`, `uploaded_by`, `uploaded_at`
9. System displays upload success:
   - Green checkmark ✅ next to evidence type
   - File preview (inline for images/PDFs, download link for code)

**Postcondition**: Evidence uploaded, SHA256 recorded, checklist updated.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

   You are an expert software engineer following SDLC 5.1.3 Complete Lifecycle.

   CURRENT STAGE: WHAT (Design & Planning)
   GATE: G1 Design Ready
   EXIT CRITERIA: Write TDD test cases BEFORE writing implementation code.

   USER STORY:
   {user_story}

   TASK: Generate Python pytest test cases that validate ALL acceptance criteria.

   REQUIREMENTS:
   - Use pytest framework
   - Test ONLY external behavior (black-box testing)
   - Cover happy path + edge cases + error cases
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Include docstrings explaining WHAT is tested (not HOW)

   OUTPUT: Python code only (no explanations).
   ```

   - Model: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
   - Temperature: 0.2 (deterministic for code)
   - Max tokens: 4096
8. Claude returns TDD tests:
   ```python
   import pytest
   from app.auth import login

   def test_login_success_valid_credentials():
       """User can log in with valid email and password."""
       # Arrange
       email = "user@example.com"
       password = "SecurePass123"

       # Act
       result = login(email, password)

       # Assert
       assert result.success is True
       assert result.access_token is not None

   def test_login_failure_invalid_email():
       """Login fails with invalid email format."""
       # Arrange
       email = "invalid-email"
       password = "SecurePass123"

       # Act
       result = login(email, password)

       # Assert
       assert result.success is False
       assert result.error == "INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT"

   # ... (10 more test cases)
   ```
9. System displays generated tests in code editor (Monaco Editor)
10. User reviews tests:
    - Edit directly in browser
    - Click "Save as Evidence" to upload to vault

### FR3.2: Multi-Provider Routing

#### Use Case 3.2.1: Route Request to Best AI Provider

**Actor**: System (automated)
**Precondition**: User clicks "AI: Generate Evidence"
**Trigger**: AI request received

**Main Flow**:
1. System analyzes request context:
   - Stage: WHAT (complex reasoning needed)
   - Evidence type: TDD_TESTS (code generation)
   - Input length: 500 tokens
2. System applies routing logic:
   - **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Complex reasoning (Design Thinking, TDD, runbooks)
   - **GPT-4o**: Code generation (implementation, unit tests)
   - **Gemini**: Bulk tasks (summarization, translation, low-cost)
3. System selects provider: Claude (complex reasoning for WHAT stage)
4. System checks rate limits:
   - Claude: 50 RPM (requests per minute)
   - Current usage: 10 RPM
   - **IF** under limit: Proceed
   - **IF** over limit: Fallback to GPT-4o
5. System calls selected provider API
6. System tracks usage:
   - Table: `ai_usage_logs`
   - Columns: `gate_id`, `provider`, `model`, `tokens`, `cost_usd`, `timestamp`

**Postcondition**: AI request routed to optimal provider, usage tracked.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: System routes to correct provider based on stage + evidence type
- AC2: System falls back to alternate provider on rate limit (Claude → GPT-4o → Gemini)
- AC3: System tracks costs per gate (visible in dashboard)
- AC4: System respects monthly budget limit ($500/month for AI)
- AC5: System logs all AI requests (audit trail for compliance)

**Routing Rules** (Configurable):
```yaml
ai_routing:
  WHAT_STAGE:
    TDD_TESTS: CLAUDE # Complex reasoning
    API_CONTRACTS: GPT4 # Code generation
    DESIGN_THINKING: CLAUDE # Creative + reasoning

  BUILD_STAGE:
    IMPLEMENTATION: GPT4 # Code generation
    CODE_REVIEW: CLAUDE # Analysis

  OPERATE_STAGE:

### FR3.3: Cost Tracking and Budget Limits

#### Use Case 3.3.1: Track AI Costs Per Gate

**Actor**: System (automated)
**Precondition**: AI request completed
**Trigger**: AI provider returns response

**Main Flow**:
1. System receives AI response with token usage:
   ```json
   {
     "usage": {
       "prompt_tokens": 500,
       "completion_tokens": 750,
       "total_tokens": 1250
     }
   }
   ```
2. System looks up pricing (from config):
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5: $3/M input, $15/M output
   - GPT-4o: $5/M input, $15/M output
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash: $0.075/M input, $0.30/M output
3. System calculates cost:
   ```
   cost_usd = (prompt_tokens * input_price_per_1M) + (completion_tokens * output_price_per_1M)
   cost_usd = (500 * 3/1000000) + (750 * 15/1000000)
   cost_usd = 0.0015 + 0.01125 = 0.01275 (~$0.013)
   ```
4. System records cost:
   - Table: `ai_usage_logs`
   - Update gate aggregate: `gates.ai_cost_usd += 0.013`
5. System checks monthly budget:
   - Config: `AI_MONTHLY_BUDGET = $500`
   - Current month spend: `SUM(ai_cost_usd) WHERE month = 2025-11`
   - **IF** spend > budget: Send alert to CTO, block new AI requests

**Postcondition**: AI cost tracked, budget monitored.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: System calculates cost accurately (within 1 cent)
- AC2: System aggregates costs by gate, project, month
- AC3: System alerts when 80% of monthly budget consumed
- AC4: System blocks AI requests when budget exceeded (fail-safe)
- AC5: System displays cost in dashboard (real-time)

**API Contract**:
```typescript
GET /api/v1/ai/usage-stats?month=2025-11

### FR4.2: Real-Time Updates (WebSocket)

#### Use Case 4.2.1: Receive Real-Time Gate Status Updates

**Actor**: Engineering Manager
**Precondition**: Dashboard open in browser
**Trigger**: Gate status changes (e.g., approved by CTO)

**Main Flow**:
1. User opens dashboard, browser establishes WebSocket connection:
   ```
   ws://backend:8000/ws/projects/{project_id}/dashboard
   ```
2. Backend subscribes to Redis pub/sub channel:
   ```
   SUBSCRIBE project:{project_id}:gates:updates
   ```
3. Gate status changes (CTO approves Gate G2):
   - Backend updates PostgreSQL: `UPDATE gates SET status = 'APPROVED'`
   - Backend publishes event to Redis:
     ```json
     PUBLISH project:uuid:gates:updates {
       "event": "GATE_APPROVED",
       "gate_id": "uuid",
       "gate_name": "G2 Build Ready",

class QualityGateFeedback:
    attempt_number: int                    # Current attempt (1, 2, 3)
    failed_gates: List[str]               # ["gate_2_security", "gate_3_context"]
    gate_feedback: List[GateFeedbackItem] # Structured feedback per gate
    overall_vietnamese_message: str       # User-friendly summary
    previous_provider: str                # Provider that generated failed code
    recommendation: str                   # "retry_same_provider" | "try_fallback" | "escalate"
```

**Main Flow**:
1. Quality Pipeline returns failed gates with details
2. System constructs QualityGateFeedback object
3. System generates Vietnamese error message
4. System determines recommendation:
   - Syntax errors → retry same provider with specific fix
   - Security errors → try fallback provider
   - Context errors → retry with enriched IR context
   - Repeated failures → escalate
5. System injects feedback into next generation prompt

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Feedback schema standardized (Pydantic model)
- AC2: Vietnamese messages for all error categories
- AC3: Recommendation logic deterministic (no AI randomness)
- AC4: Feedback includes specific file:line references

   - IR module context
   - Project constraints
2. System routes to escalation channel:
   - **council**: AI Council reviews with multi-agent deliberation
   - **human**: Slack notification to human reviewer
   - **abort**: Mark generation as failed, no evidence created
3. Escalation handler reviews and decides:
   - Approve generated code (override quality gates)
   - Modify IR and retry
   - Abort with explanation
4. System applies decision and updates evidence state

**Acceptance Criteria**:
