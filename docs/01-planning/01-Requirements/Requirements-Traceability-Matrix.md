---

## Document Purpose

This document maps **Stage 01 Requirements (WHAT to build)** back to **Stage 00 Validated Problems (WHY to build)**.

**Key Principle**: Every functional requirement (FR) must trace back to a validated problem from Stage 00. No "nice-to-have" features allowed unless validated by user pain points.

**Traceability Format**:
- **Problem ID** (from Stage 00) → **FR ID** (from Stage 01)
- **Pain Level** (1-10 scale, from user interviews)
- **Success Metric** (measurable outcome)

---
