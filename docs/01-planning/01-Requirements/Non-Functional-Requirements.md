## Document Purpose

This document defines **WHAT quality attributes the system must meet**, not HOW to achieve them (Stage 02 scope).

**Key Categories**:
- Performance (response time, throughput)
- Scalability (concurrent users, data volume)
- Security (encryption, authentication, authorization)
- Availability (uptime SLA, disaster recovery)
- Usability (time to first value, learning curve)
- Maintainability (code quality, technical debt)
- Compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, data retention)

---

## NFR1: API Response Time

**Requirement**: API responses must be <200ms (p95) for read operations, <500ms (p95) for write operations.

**Measurements**:
- GET requests: <200ms p95 (e.g., /api/v1/gates/{id})
- POST requests: <500ms p95 (e.g., /api/v1/gates/evaluate)
- Complex queries: <1s p95 (e.g., dashboard metrics aggregation)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given production load (100 concurrent users)
When user requests gate status (GET /api/v1/gates/123)
Then response time is <200ms for 95% of requests
And response time is <500ms for 99% of requests
```

**Trade-offs**: Faster response may require caching (Redis), increased infrastructure cost.

---

## NFR2: Gate Evaluation Performance

**Requirement**: Gate evaluation must complete <500ms (p95) for 10 policy packs.

**Measurements**:
- Simple policy (1 rule): <50ms
- Complex policy (10+ rules): <200ms
- Full gate (10 policies): <500ms p95

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given gate G1 with 10 policy packs
When system evaluates gate
Then evaluation completes <500ms for 95% of requests
And OPA evaluates 10K+ policies/sec (benchmark)
```

**Dependencies**: OPA performance (10K+ evals/sec documented)

---

## NFR3: Evidence Upload Performance

**Requirement**: Evidence upload must complete <2s for 10MB file.

**Measurements**:
- 1MB file: <500ms
- 5MB file: <1s
- 10MB file: <2s

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given user uploads 10MB PDF
When upload to Evidence Vault
Then file uploaded + encrypted + virus-scanned in <2s
```

**Trade-offs**: Faster upload requires higher bandwidth (AWS S3 transfer acceleration).

---

## NFR4: Concurrent Users (Scalability)

**Requirement**: System must support 1,000 concurrent users (Year 3 target).

**Scaling Roadmap**:
- Year 1: 100 concurrent users (100 teams)
- Year 2: 500 concurrent users (454 teams)
- Year 3: 1,000 concurrent users (1,342 teams)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given 1,000 users logged in simultaneously
When all users access dashboard
Then system maintains <200ms response time (NFR1)
And no degradation in performance
```

**Architecture**: Auto-scaling (1-10 backend instances), load balancer (AWS ALB).

---

## NFR5: Data Volume (Scalability)

**Requirement**: System must handle 10TB total evidence storage (Year 3: 1,342 teams × 10GB/team).

**Storage Roadmap**:
- Year 1: 1TB (100 teams × 10GB)
- Year 2: 4.5TB (454 teams × 10GB)
- Year 3: 13TB (1,342 teams × 10GB)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given 10TB evidence stored in MinIO
When user searches evidence
Then search completes <200ms (NFR1)
And storage costs <$230/month (AWS S3 pricing: $23/TB)
```

**Cost Optimization**: MinIO self-hosted (free) vs AWS S3 ($23/TB/month).

---

## NFR6: Database Scalability

**Requirement**: PostgreSQL must handle 100M+ rows (Year 3 projection).

**Data Growth**:
- evidence table: 50M rows (1,342 teams × 10K evidence/team × 3 years)
- gates table: 10M rows (1,342 teams × 8 gates × 1K evaluations)
- audit_logs table: 100M rows (all user actions logged)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given PostgreSQL with 100M rows
When complex query (JOIN 3 tables)
Then query completes <1s (NFR1)
And no table scans (indexes enforced)
```

**Architecture**: Read replicas (2x), connection pooling (PgBouncer 1K connections).

---

## NFR7: Data Encryption

**Requirement**: All data encrypted at-rest (AES-256) and in-transit (TLS 1.3).

**Scope**:
- Evidence files: AES-256 (MinIO encryption)
- Database: AES-256 (PostgreSQL pgcrypto)
- API traffic: TLS 1.3 (HTTPS enforced)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given evidence file uploaded
Then file encrypted with AES-256 before storage
And encryption key rotated every 90 days
And decryption only with valid user authentication
```

**Compliance**: SOC 2 Type I requires encryption at-rest + in-transit.

---

## NFR8: Authentication & Authorization

**Requirement**: RBAC enforced with C-Suite + Engineering roles (Stage 00-09 SDLC Framework).

**Roles & Permissions**:

| Gate | Stage | Approver(s) Required | Rationale |
|------|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| G0.1 | Stage 00 (WHY - Problem Foundation) | CPO + EM | Problem validated (5+ users) |
| G0.2 | Stage 00 (WHY - Business Case) | CEO + CPO | Strategic alignment ($4.7M+ value) |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given user role = EM
When user attempts to override gate
Then API returns 403 Forbidden
And audit log records unauthorized attempt

Given user role = CTO
When user overrides gate G2 (Architecture)
Then override succeeds
And audit log records: user_id, gate_id, reason, timestamp
And CPO receives notification (approval required for stage transition)

Given user role = CEO
When user approves emergency gate override
Then override succeeds (all gates)
And audit log marked as "EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE"
And all C-Suite notified via Slack
```

**Implementation**:
- JWT tokens (exp 1 hour), refresh tokens (exp 7 days)
- Role hierarchy: CEO > CTO/CPO/CIO/CFO > Admin > EM/PM/Dev Lead/QA Lead
- Multi-approval workflow: Gates G0.2, G1, G2 require 2+ approvers (e.g., G1 = CTO + CPO)

- Unplanned outage budget: 4.76 hours/year

**Acceptance Criteria**:

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Given 10 beta users complete SUS survey
When scores aggregated
Then average SUS score >70
And no critical usability issues (score <50)
```

**Testing**: Beta Week 11 (10 teams × 2 users = 20 SUS surveys).

## Testing Strategy (NFRs)

### Performance Testing
- **Load testing**: Simulate 1,000 concurrent users (JMeter, Locust)
- **Stress testing**: Find breaking point (max concurrent users)
- **Benchmarking**: OPA 10K+ evals/sec, PostgreSQL 100K+ rows/sec

### Security Testing
- **Penetration testing**: Week 12 (external firm, $10K budget)
- **Vulnerability scanning**: ClamAV, Dependabot, Snyk
- **RBAC testing**: Verify EM cannot override gates (403 Forbidden)

### Availability Testing
- **Chaos engineering**: Simulate failures (Chaos Monkey)
- **Disaster recovery drill**: Test RTO <1 hour, RPO <5 min

### Usability Testing
- **SUS survey**: Beta Week 11 (10 teams × 2 users = 20 surveys)
- **Time to First Value**: Track onboarding duration (target <1 hour)
