# Governance Failure: Frontend Duplication - Lessons Learned

**Incident Date:** Sprint 65-78 (Post-Sprint 64)  
**Discovery Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Severity:** 🔴 **P1 - Major Governance Failure**  
**Category:** Architectural Drift, Process Failure  
**Framework:** SDLC 5.1.3 - Pillar 7 (Govern)

---

## Executive Summary

**The Irony:** We are building a governance and safety platform for AI+human teams, yet we failed to govern our own project architecture.

**What Happened:**
- **Sprint 61-64:** Unified frontend migration (ADR-025) completed successfully
- **Sprint 65-78:** Team created 2 separate frontend services again (`frontend-landing` + `frontend-web`)
- **January 2026:** Must re-merge services back into unified `frontend` (ADR-025 completion)

**Impact:**
- 13+ sprints of architectural drift
- Duplicate code, dependencies, and build pipelines
- Rework effort to re-unify services
- Erosion of architectural decisions (ADR-025 ignored)

**Root Cause:** Lack of enforcement of ADR decisions and architectural governance during sprint execution.

## Timeline of Events

### Sprint 61-64: Unified Frontend Migration (ADR-025)

**Decision:** [ADR-025: Frontend Platform Consolidation - Next.js Monolith](../../02-design/01-ADRs/ADR-025-Frontend-Platform-Consolidation-Nextjs-Monolith.md)

**Architecture Before:**
```
frontend-landing (Next.js) → port 8311  [Marketing, SEO, Auth, Docs]
frontend-web (React Vite)  → port 8310  [Authenticated Dashboard]
```

**Architecture After ADR-025:**
```
frontend (Next.js Unified) → port 8310  [All routes]
```

**Status:** ✅ Migration completed in Sprint 61-64

**Routes Unified:**
- `/` - Landing page
- `/login`, `/register`, `/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/app/*` - Authenticated dashboard
- `/admin/*` - Admin panel (superuser)
- `/docs/*` - Documentation
- `/checkout/*` - Payment

### Sprint 65-78: Architectural Drift (13 Sprints)

**What Happened:**
- Team unknowingly reverted to dual-frontend architecture
- Created separate services:
  - `frontend-landing` (Next.js) on port 8311
  - `frontend-web` (React Vite) on port 8310
- Duplicate `docker-compose.yml` services
- Duplicate NGINX configurations
- Duplicate build pipelines

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (Reverted State - INCORRECT)
services:
  frontend-landing:
    build: ./frontend-landing
    ports:
      - "8311:3000"
  
  frontend-web:
    build: ./frontend-web
    ports:
      - "8310:3000"
```

**Why This Happened:**
- ADR-025 not enforced during sprint execution
- No architectural review gate in sprint planning
- Team unfamiliarity with ADR decisions
- No automated checks for architectural compliance

### January 19, 2026: Re-Unification Required

**Current Corrective Action:**
- Re-merge services back into unified `frontend`
- Update `docker-compose.yml` to single service
- Update NGINX config to remove legacy Vite routes
- Restore ADR-025 architecture

**Target State (Restoring ADR-025):**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (CORRECT State)
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "8310:3000"
    container_name: sdlc-frontend
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
```

**Container Status (Corrected):**
```
sdlc-frontend    8310:3000    healthy
sdlc-backend     8300:8300    healthy
```

## Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

### Why 1: Why did team create 2 frontend services again?

**Answer:** Team was unaware ADR-025 had already unified the frontend.

### Why 2: Why was team unaware of ADR-025?

**Answer:** ADR decisions not communicated during sprint kickoffs, no onboarding for ADRs.

### Why 3: Why weren't ADR decisions communicated during sprint planning?

**Answer:** No mandatory ADR review step in sprint planning checklist.

### Why 4: Why is there no mandatory ADR review step?

**Answer:** Governance process (SDLC Pillar 7) not enforced in our own sprints.

### Why 5: Why isn't governance enforced in our own sprints?

**Answer:** ⚠️ **We are not using our own governance platform to manage our own development.**

---

## The Core Irony

| What We Preach | What We Practice |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Governance-first platform** | Failed to govern our own architecture |
| **ADR-driven decisions** | Ignored ADR-025 for 13 sprints |
| **Sprint gates (G-Sprint-Open, G-Sprint-Close)** | No architectural review gate enforced |
| **AI Council for governance** | Not used for our own architectural decisions |
| **Transparency and traceability** | No automated ADR compliance checks |

**The Hard Truth:** We cannot credibly sell a governance platform if we cannot govern our own codebase.

## Impact Assessment

### Technical Impact

**Wasted Effort:**
- Sprint 61-64: Unified frontend (4 sprints investment)
- Sprint 65-78: Unknowingly reverted (13 sprints drift)
- Sprint 79+: Re-unify again (rework)

**Code Duplication:**
- Duplicate UI components across 2 frontends
- Duplicate dependency trees (`package.json` × 2)
- Duplicate build pipelines (Vite + Next.js)
- Duplicate Docker images (2 containers instead of 1)

**Infrastructure Complexity:**
- 2 containers instead of 1 (double resource usage)
- 2 NGINX upstream configs to maintain
- 2 deployment workflows

### Business Impact

**Credibility Risk:**
- Hard to pitch governance platform when we can't govern ourselves
- Potential investor concern: "Do they practice what they preach?"

**Velocity Impact:**
- Rework time to re-unify (estimated 2-3 days)
- Context switching between 2 frontend codebases
- Slower feature delivery due to code duplication

**Cost Impact:**
- Extra infrastructure costs (2 containers vs 1)
- Development time wasted on maintaining 2 frontends

## Contributing Factors

### Process Gaps

1. **No ADR Enforcement Mechanism**
   - ADRs stored in `/docs/02-design/01-ADRs/` but not checked during sprint planning
   - No automated tool to verify code compliance with ADRs

2. **No Architectural Review Gate**
   - G-Sprint-Open doesn't include architectural review
   - Team can start sprint without confirming alignment with ADRs

3. **No Onboarding for ADRs**
   - New team members unaware of architectural decisions
   - No ADR changelog or summary document

4. **Lack of "Dogfooding"**
   - We don't use our own SDLC Orchestrator to manage SDLC Orchestrator development
   - Not testing our own governance features on our own project

### Human Factors

1. **Team Turnover/Rotation**
   - Team members who executed Sprint 61-64 may differ from Sprint 65-78
   - Institutional knowledge lost

2. **Sprint Pressure**
   - Focus on feature delivery over architectural consistency
   - "Ship fast, clean up later" mentality

3. **Communication Gap**
   - ADR decisions communicated once (Sprint 61-64) then forgotten
   - No reminder system for architectural constraints

# .adr-compliance.yml
rules:
  - name: "ADR-025: Single Frontend Service"
    check: "docker-compose.yml contains only 1 frontend service"
    pattern: "services:\\n\\s+frontend:"
    forbidden_patterns:
      - "frontend-landing:"
      - "frontend-web:"
    error_message: "ADR-025 violated: Multiple frontend services detected. Use unified 'frontend' service."
  
  - name: "ADR-025: Frontend Port 8310"
    check: "Frontend service uses port 8310"
    pattern: "frontend:.*ports:.*8310:3000"
    error_message: "ADR-025 violated: Frontend must run on port 8310."
```

**Implementation:**
- Add `.adr-compliance.yml` rules file
- Integrate with pre-commit hooks
- Add to CI/CD pipeline (fail build if ADR violated)

**Owner:** DevOps Lead

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Governance Process Not Applied to Ourselves**
   - We built governance features but didn't use them
   - ADR decisions documented but not enforced

2. **No Architectural Review in Sprint Gates**
   - G-Sprint-Open focused on feature readiness, not architectural compliance
   - Missing checkpoint: "Does this sprint violate any ADRs?"

3. **Knowledge Transfer Gap**
   - Team members unaware of Sprint 61-64 decisions
   - ADRs stored in `/docs/` but not actively referenced

4. **No Automated Guardrails**
   - Manual review of architectural compliance (error-prone)
   - No pre-commit hooks or CI checks for ADR rules

### What We'll Do Differently

1. **Mandatory ADR Review in G-Sprint-Open**
   - Every sprint starts with ADR compliance check
   - Tech Lead must confirm no architectural decisions violated

2. **Automated ADR Compliance**
   - Pre-commit hooks enforce key architectural rules
   - CI/CD fails build if ADR violated
   - Remove human error from the equation

3. **Dogfood Our Own Platform**
   - Use SDLC Orchestrator to manage our own development
   - Test governance features on real sprints (ours)
   - Build credibility: "We use what we sell"

4. **Living ADR Documentation**
   - ADR Active Summary maintained as single source of truth
   - Updated after every ADR approval/deprecation
   - Reviewed during team onboarding

---

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication

**To:** Engineering Team, Product Team, Leadership  
**When:** Sprint 79 Kickoff (Jan 27, 2026)  
**Format:** All-Hands Meeting (30 minutes)

**Agenda:**
1. Present this lessons learned document
2. Explain root cause (governance not applied to ourselves)
3. Announce corrective actions (re-unify frontend, dogfood platform)
4. Commit to preventative actions (ADR enforcement, automation)
