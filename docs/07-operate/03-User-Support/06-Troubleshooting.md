### Bulk Delete Not Working (FIXED)

**Symptoms**: Bulk delete returns 422 error

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** on December 20, 2025

**What Was Wrong**:
- FastAPI was matching `/users/bulk` against `/users/{user_id}` route first
- "bulk" failed UUID validation
- Route ordering issue in backend

**Solution Applied**:
- Reordered routes: bulk delete now before single delete
- Added validation error handler
- Added explicit Content-Type header in frontend

**If Still Having Issues**:
1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   ```
   Ctrl+Shift+Del → Clear cache
   Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
   ```

2. **Check Production Deployment**
   ```
   # For admins
   docker logs backend | grep "BULK DELETE"
   # Should see: "=== BULK DELETE ENDPOINT CALLED ==="
   ```

3. **Verify Backend Version**
   ```
   GET /api/health
   Should show commit: e3215ec or later
   ```

4. **Contact Support**
   - Include: user IDs being deleted, error message
   - Check browser console (F12 → Console)

### Gate Approval Stuck

**Symptoms**: Gate shows "In Review" but no progress

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Reviewer Assignments**
   ```

   - Ensure reviewers have been notified
   - Check reviewer email/notifications
   ```

2. **Evidence Completeness**
   ```
   - All required evidence submitted?
   - AI Council flagged any issues?
   - Missing artifacts?
   ```

3. **Notify Reviewers**
   ```
   - Send reminder via platform
   - Contact reviewers directly
   - Check reviewer availability
   ```

4. **Check Permissions**
   ```
   - Reviewers have "Reviewer" or "Admin" role?
   - Project access granted?
   ```

5. **Escalate**
   ```
   - Contact project lead
   - Escalate to admin if urgent
   - Consider gate waiver if justified
   ```

### AI Council Not Responding

**Symptoms**: AI Council review not appearing or taking too long

**Solutions**:

1. **Wait for Processing**

   ```
   # For admins
   docker logs backend | grep "AI Council"

   ```

5. **Fallback to Manual Review**
   ```
   - Proceed with human reviewer
   - AI Council optional, not required
   ```

   If PDF fails: Try Excel
   If Excel fails: Try CSV

   ```

2. **Filters Applied**
   ```

   ```

3. **Large Projects**
   ```
   - Filter data by date range
   - Paginate large lists
   - Use search instead of browsing
   ```

4. **Server Load**
   ```
   # For admins
   Check server resources:
   docker stats
   Monitor CPU, RAM, disk usage
   Scale if necessary
   ```

## Advanced Troubleshooting (For Admins)

### Backend Debugging

**Check Logs**
```bash
# All backend logs
docker logs backend -f

# Filter for errors
docker logs backend 2>&1 | grep ERROR

# Specific user/project
docker logs backend 2>&1 | grep "user_id=123"
```

**Database Access**
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker exec -it postgres psql -U sdlc

# Check user count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

# Check gate status
SELECT project_id, gate_id, status FROM gates;
```

**Health Check**
```bash
# API health
curl https://sdlc.nhatquangholding.com/api/health

# Database connection
docker exec backend python -c "from app.db import get_db; next(get_db())"
```

### Frontend Debugging

**Browser Console**
```javascript
// Open DevTools (F12)
// Check Console for errors
// Network tab for API calls
// Application tab for localStorage
```

**Clear Everything**
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
