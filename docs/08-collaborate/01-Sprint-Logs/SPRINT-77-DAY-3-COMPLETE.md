**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Day 3 Deliverables

### 1. ForecastService (`backend/app/services/forecast_service.py`)

Created complete sprint forecasting service:

```python
class ForecastService:
    """AI-powered sprint forecasting service."""

    async def forecast_completion(self, sprint_id: UUID) -> SprintForecast:
        """Predict sprint completion probability."""
```

**Features**:
- **Probability Calculation**: Based on burn rate ratio with penalties
- **Burn Rate Analysis**: Current vs required points per day
- **Risk Identification**: Blocked items, P0 incomplete, behind schedule
- **Recommendation Engine**: AI-generated actionable suggestions
- **Predicted End Date**: Based on current burn rate projection

**Probability Formula**:
```python
base_prob = min(100, (current_burn_rate / required_rate) * 100)
penalties = blocked_count * 5 + p0_incomplete * 10
final = max(0, base_prob - penalties)
```

**Risk Types**:
| Type | Trigger | Penalty |
|------|---------|---------|
| `blocked_items` | blocked_count > 0 | -5% each |
| `p0_incomplete` | P0 items not done | -10% each |
| `behind_schedule` | burn_rate < 70% required | High/Critical |
| `low_completion` | probability < 50% | High/Critical |
| `time_pressure` | days_remaining <= 2 | High |

### 2. Forecast Schemas (`backend/app/schemas/planning.py`)

Added two new Pydantic v2 schemas:

```python
class ForecastRiskResponse(BaseModel):
    """Identified risk factor."""
    risk_type: str  # blocked_items, p0_incomplete, behind_schedule, etc.
    severity: str   # low, medium, high, critical
    message: str
    recommendation: str

class SprintForecastResponse(BaseModel):
    """Sprint completion forecast."""
    sprint_id: UUID
    sprint_number: int
    sprint_name: str
    probability: float  # 0-100%
    predicted_end_date: Optional[date]
    on_track: bool
    remaining_points: int
    total_points: int
    completed_points: int
    current_burn_rate: float
    required_burn_rate: float
    days_elapsed: int
    days_remaining: int
    risks: list[ForecastRiskResponse]
    recommendations: list[str]
```

### 3. API Endpoint (`backend/app/api/routes/planning.py`)

Added new endpoint:

```http
GET /api/v1/planning/sprints/{sprint_id}/forecast
```

**Response**: `SprintForecastResponse`
**Rate Limit**: 10 req/min per user (reuses analytics limiter)
**Auth**: Requires authenticated user with project access

### 4. Integration Tests (`backend/tests/integration/test_sprint_forecast.py`)

Created 8 comprehensive tests:

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `test_probability_calculation_on_track` | High probability when ahead |
| `test_probability_calculation_behind` | Low probability when behind |
| `test_probability_with_blocked_items` | Blocked items penalty |
| `test_probability_with_p0_incomplete` | P0 incomplete penalty |
| `test_risk_identification_blocked` | Risk type and severity |
| `test_risk_identification_behind_schedule` | Behind schedule detection |
| `test_recommendation_for_p0_incomplete` | Recommendation generation |
| `test_forecast_schema_validation` | Schema validation |

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Action | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| `backend/app/services/forecast_service.py` | Created | 400+ |
| `backend/app/schemas/planning.py` | Modified | +65 |
| `backend/app/api/routes/planning.py` | Modified | +110 |
| `backend/tests/integration/test_sprint_forecast.py` | Created | 320+ |

## Technical Notes

### Risk Severity Levels

| Severity | Trigger | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `low` | 1 blocked item | Monitor |
| `medium` | 2 blocked items | Review daily |
| `high` | 3+ blocked or < 70% burn rate | Escalate |
| `critical` | < 50% burn rate or 2+ P0 incomplete | Emergency standup |

### Recommendations Algorithm

Recommendations are generated based on:
1. **P0 Priority**: Always recommend completing P0 first
2. **Blockers**: Recommend unblocking if count > 0
3. **Velocity**: Suggest pair programming if burn rate < 50%
4. **Time**: Focus on committed items if days remaining <= 2
5. **Success**: Encourage team if on track

### Performance Optimization

- Single query for backlog items (no N+1)
- All calculations in memory (O(n))
- Response time target: <100ms p95

## Day 4 Preview: Retrospective Automation

Next implementation will include:
- **RetrospectiveService**: Auto-generate sprint retrospective
- **Metrics Collection**: Completion rate, velocity trend
- **Insight Generation**: "Went well" and "Needs improvement"
- **Action Items**: Auto-suggested improvements
