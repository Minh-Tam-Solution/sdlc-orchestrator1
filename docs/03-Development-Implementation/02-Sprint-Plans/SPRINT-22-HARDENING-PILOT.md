## Day 1: Performance Optimization

### Tasks

| # | Task | File | Est. | Owner |
|---|------|------|------|-------|
| 1.1 | Run load tests (Locust) | tests/load/locust_scenarios.py | 2h | BE |
| 1.2 | Optimize slow queries | backend/app/db/queries.py | 3h | BE |
| 1.3 | Add Redis caching | backend/app/services/cache_service.py | 2h | BE |
| 1.4 | Frontend bundle optimization | frontend/web/vite.config.ts | 1h | FE |

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| API latency (p95) | ~150ms | <100ms | P0 |
| Dashboard load | ~2s | <1s | P0 |
| Gate evaluation | ~200ms | <100ms | P0 |
| Evidence upload (10MB) | ~5s | <2s | P1 |
| Compliance scan | ~60s | <30s | P1 |

### Optimization Strategies

```python
# 1. Query Optimization - Add indexes
# backend/alembic/versions/xxx_add_performance_indexes.py

def upgrade():
    # Composite indexes for common queries
    op.create_index('idx_gates_project_status', 'gates', ['project_id', 'status'])
    op.create_index('idx_evidence_gate_type', 'gate_evidence', ['gate_id', 'evidence_type'])
    op.create_index('idx_scans_project_date', 'compliance_scans', ['project_id', 'scanned_at'])

    # Partial indexes for active records
    op.execute("""
        CREATE INDEX idx_projects_active ON projects(id)
        WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
    """)

# 2. Redis Caching - Cache frequently accessed data
# backend/app/services/cache_service.py

class CacheService:
    def __init__(self, redis: Redis):
        self.redis = redis
        self.default_ttl = 300  # 5 minutes

    async def get_project_stats(self, project_id: str) -> ProjectStats:
        """Cache project statistics for dashboard."""
        cache_key = f"project_stats:{project_id}"

        # Try cache first
        cached = await self.redis.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return ProjectStats.parse_raw(cached)

        # Compute and cache
        stats = await compute_project_stats(project_id)
        await self.redis.setex(cache_key, self.default_ttl, stats.json())
        return stats

    async def invalidate_project_cache(self, project_id: str):
        """Invalidate cache when project changes."""
        await self.redis.delete(f"project_stats:{project_id}")
```

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)

# Apply to auth endpoints
@router.post("/login")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")
async def login(request: Request):
    pass

@router.post("/refresh")
@limiter.limit("30/minute")
async def refresh(request: Request):
    pass

# Global rate limit
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, rate_limit_exceeded_handler)
```

### Deliverables
