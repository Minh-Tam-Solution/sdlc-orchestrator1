## ❌ Failed/Skipped Tests Analysis

### Failed Test: 4.2 - Gates list or empty state

**Root Cause**: Login timeout issue - race condition in parallel tests

**Analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Test Issue**: Race condition in parallel test execution
- ⚠️ **Not App Bug**: Application works correctly
- ⚠️ **Impact**: 6 tests skipped (dependent on this test)

**Fix Required**:
1. Add proper test isolation (separate login per test)
2. Increase timeout for login operations
3. Use sequential execution for dependent tests
4. Add retry logic for login operations

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours

---

### Skipped Tests (6 tests)

**Dependent Tests**:
- 4.4, 4.5 (Gate Management)
- 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 (Evidence Management - Journey 5)
- A.2 (Accessibility)

**Root Cause**: Dependent on failed test 4.2 (Gates list)

**Fix**: Once test 4.2 is fixed, these tests will run automatically

**Estimated Effort**: 0 hours (auto-fixed when 4.2 is fixed)
