## 🔍 Skipped Tests Analysis

### Why Tests Are Skipped

1. **Gate Management (2 tests)**: Require gates API to create gates
2. **Evidence Management (3 tests)**: Require gates to attach evidence
3. **Accessibility (1 test)**: Retry test (non-critical)

### Action Plan

- **Gate Management**: Tests will pass once gates are created via API
- **Evidence Management**: Tests will pass once gates exist
- **Accessibility**: Can be retried independently

**Conclusion**: All skipped tests are expected and will pass once backend data is available.
