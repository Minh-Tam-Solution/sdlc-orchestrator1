## 📊 User Value Assessment

### P0-03: Project CRUD UI - User Value: 9/10

**User Stories Addressed**:
1. ✅ "As an Engineering Manager, I want to edit project name when I make a typo, so that I don't have to create a new project"

- ✅ **Scope Updates**: Project descriptions can be updated as goals change
- ✅ **List Management**: Old projects can be archived (soft delete)

- **Support Tickets**: -30% (fewer "how do I edit project?" questions)
- **User Retention**: +5% (removes friction point)
- **Data Quality**: +20% (fewer duplicate projects)

## 💡 Product Recommendations

### Immediate (P1)

**Rationale**:
- Gates are primary feature (higher value than GitHub Settings)
- Users need to edit/delete gates (same pattern as projects)
- Completes gate management workflow

**Timeline**: 4 hours (1 developer-day)

### Short-term (Post-P1)

**CPO Recommendation**: Defer advanced features (Policy Detail, Manual Sync)

**Rationale**:
- Advanced features can wait until after MVP launch
- Focus on core workflows first
- Gather user feedback before building advanced features
