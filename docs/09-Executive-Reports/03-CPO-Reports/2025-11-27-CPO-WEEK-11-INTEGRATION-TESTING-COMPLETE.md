- ✅ Metrics endpoint working
- ✅ HTTP request metrics included
- ✅ Response time metrics included

### API Endpoint Testing ✅

| Endpoint | Result | Latency |
|----------|--------|---------|
| GET /health | ✅ PASS | 13.9ms |
| GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats | ✅ PASS | 40ms |
| GET /api/v1/projects | ✅ PASS | 15ms |
| GET /api/v1/gates | ✅ PASS | 16ms |
| GET /api/v1/policies | ✅ PASS | 12ms |
| GET /api/v1/auth/me | ✅ PASS | - |
| POST /api/v1/projects | ✅ PASS | - |
| POST /api/v1/gates | ✅ PASS | - |

**All API endpoints < 100ms p95 target ✅**
