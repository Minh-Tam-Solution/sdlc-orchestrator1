TeamMember Model - User-Team Membership with SASE Roles
SDLC Orchestrator - Sprint 70 (Teams Foundation)

Version: 1.0.0
Date: January 20, 2026
Status: ACTIVE - Sprint 70 Implementation
Authority: Backend Lead + CTO Approved
Reference: ADR-028-Teams-Feature-Architecture
Reference: Teams-Data-Model-Specification.md

Purpose:
- Many-to-many relationship between users and teams
- Role-based access within teams (owner, admin, member, ai_agent)
- SASE member type tracking (human vs ai_agent)

SDLC 5.1.2 Alignment:
- CTO R1: ai_agent role for SE4A (Agent Executor)
- CTO R2: member_type column (human/ai_agent)
- SASE Constraint: AI agents cannot be owner/admin

    TeamMember model - junction table for User-Team many-to-many.

    Represents a user's membership in a team with specific role and type.
    Supports both human users (SE4H) and AI agents (SE4A) per SASE framework.

    SDLC 5.1.2 SASE Roles:
        - owner: SE4H with full VCR authority (create, delete team)
        - admin: SE4H for member/settings management
        - member: SE4H/SE4A for implementation work
        - ai_agent: SE4A (Agent Executor) for autonomous tasks

    SASE Constraint (CTO R1/R2):
        AI agents (member_type='ai_agent') cannot have owner/admin roles.
        This enforces human oversight for governance decisions.

    Fields:
        id: UUID primary key
        team_id: Parent team
        user_id: Member user (human or AI agent)
        role: Role in team (owner, admin, member, ai_agent)
        member_type: Type of member (human, ai_agent)
        joined_at: When the user joined the team
        created_at: Creation timestamp
        updated_at: Last update timestamp
        deleted_at: Soft delete timestamp (NULL = active)

    Relationships:
        team: Many-to-One with Team
        user: Many-to-One with User

    Indexes:
        - team_id - Fast team member lookup
        - user_id - Fast user team lookup
        - role - Role-based queries
        - member_type - Type-based queries
        - (team_id, user_id) unique - One membership per team

    Role Hierarchy:
        owner > admin > member >= ai_agent
        - owner: Full control (delete team, transfer ownership)
        - admin: Manage members, settings (cannot delete team)
        - member: Work on projects, submit evidence
        - ai_agent: Autonomous task execution (SE4A)
